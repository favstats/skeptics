Title: Stop Defending Trump's Sexual Assault! (ReUploaded!)
Date: 2016-10-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5-1OC9d-Y
Description: Why defending Trump's sexual assault makes you a creepy weirdo!

I originally took this video down and made a retraction video. The things I say in this video are very harsh and I was afraid I was being unfair to Trump. But because of the recent new claims of groping and creepy behavior on the part of Trump by numerous other women, I've been asked to put the original video back up. So here it is.

In hindsight, I was a bit more emotional in this video than I prefer to be. This is a sensitive subject for me as I have two women very close to me who were sexually assaulted. I've also been out to clubs with friends and had them sexually assaulted in a very similar way as Trump describes doing. So admittedly I got a bit "triggered". 

One of the main "creepy" things Trump supporters are saying to excuse Trumps words and alleged actions is that because Trump says "They let him." its not sexual assault. Well just because someone doesn't report you for doing something is not the same thing as "letting you". Especially if you are the boss or in a position of authority. 

I actually do think Bill Clinton may have done worse things, but all you dudes who are excusing Trump for this shit just because you hate Hillary are only ensuring this kind of stupid shit continues.

I am in the process of moving and will be back to regular content soon.

So quick correction. The site wasn't "Facials4u.com". it was aaahhh.com. I actually had Facials4U as a subdomain on this other server which was like geocities for porn. They let you host your adult website on their server in exchange for placing one of their banners on each page, so they made money off your traffic too. I took the money from that and bought aaahhh.com because all the adult search listing wherein alphabetical order and it gave me an extreme advantage. Sorry for telling the story wrong but these things happened 20 years ago.

Title: Muslim Responds to "If You Are a Muslim You Are Retarded!"

Here is a link to the full response video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUrpp4sFt5g

I noticed after shooting this video one of my cats had scratched my lip and chin and made it look like I have herpes. I thought about reshooting the entire video but then I figured fuck you all... you can just deal with my herpes face! Let count how many people mention it without bothering to read the description.

Also, I've always pronounced his name "Bob Fossie" and I shot my first take pronouncing it that way, but then I watched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNgeDwk2NJo and it made me second guess myself on how to pronounce it. Made me feel stupid like I have been saying his name wrong all these years. But I shouldn't have second guessed myself because I have since found out I was originally right and "Fossie" is the correct pronunciation. Now I feel like an idiot. My bad.

Date: 2013-12-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QHcIOUdZCr4
Description: So this is the first video I have ever done that I've seriously considered removing because I worry it might negatively affect my brand. It seems that many people missed what I was attempting to do, and to them I came off as superficial and mean. The video was actually meant to point out how fake and unrealistic the standards of beauty are in this country, and to encourage men not to judge normal women too harshly based of a fantasy that doesn't exist. Clearly by reading the comments, I failed to properly convey that message. Please watch this complete until the end before you judge and then give me your opinion. Should I take it down or leave it up?

Date: 2013-11-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tCKhxDHtRBY
Description: One of the most hilarious scenes of all time fit perfectly over one of the biggest doofs of all time. The audio is Ricky Gervais from "The Invention of Lying", One of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion.

I got the idea for this video from https://www.youtube.com/user/Wittgensteinism . Be sure to check his stuff out and sub if you like it. I felt that his video was such a good idea that it needed to be redone, so I started from scratch with slightly better footage (but still ass) and much better audio and I remixed the video to match the words from scratch. 

The song at the end is "Poison" by Tombstone Da Deadman. Check him out here: http://www.youtube.com/user/rationalwarrior

Date: 2013-10-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xhgVbbDBJ24
Description: Your local news people are just actors reading scripts. Other than a few local stories, the news fed to us mostly comes from the same place, press releases, and stock stories from the AP wire. Very little of what you see is original. It is all cookie cutter and then spooned to you in your local flavor.

All these clips are from the Conan O'Brian show.

http://www.cultofdusty.com/?page_id=938

Lyrics: Come on and eat them up! Get on down and feeling kinda phony. Rockin to the beat just like a Butt Pony. Get on down and feeling kinda phony. rockin to the, rockin to the, rockin to the beat. Get on down and feeling kinda phony. Rockin to the beat just like a Butt Pony. Get on down and feeling kinda phony, Butt Ponies taste great! Once knew a boy, called himself G-lo. working at the bell, serving the burrito. He don't care about none of that though. waiting for the weekend to go get in the funky flow. Friday comes he's out on the dance floor. Jumping all around like he's a little slow. Looking for a girly he can take home. Never realizing he's just a big joke... Once met a pony in a fraternity. Thought that he was so much better then me. Poor guy probably will never see. Wasted his life acting like a poney. Every nite another keg party. Bragging no one can drink more then he. Gonna drink until he can't see. Looking for a way to end his misery... Once saw a pony with an IQ below, that of a dead retarded armadillo. Kept braggin about a huge libido. Wanted to smother him with a pillow. Cuz I know he's just another dildo. Talking trash but his games a no go. Spends all his time whacking it solo. His Jimmys smaller then that Hobbit Frodo.

Title: Christians Freak Out Over Obama's Win - Banned From Youtube!
Date: 2012-11-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8HVzYgU6c8k
Description: The original video was censored by Youtube and deleted off the internet. Here is an edited version. There was a concerted effort by people in my area to have this video removed and to shut me up. Youtube finally gave in and claims they banned it because I used people's real names. This makes absolutely no sense. How the fuck are you suppose to quote someone without using their real name? It's okay for these people to go on the internet and publicly call Obama a "nigger", but it's not okay for me to take a screenshot of it and read it word for word? The system is fucked. 

Please share this video and help spread the word about Youtube's retarded censorship problems. Hundreds of people shared links to the original video, and now all those links are dead and thus this video will be seen far fewer times than it normally would. The people trying to shut me up are sadly winning. Hopefully you guys will help me to overcome those who want to silence the message.

Also, Logic Tee's are available @ www.CultofDusty.com and sales really do help support this channel and ensure their is more frequent content. Thank you.

Title: Why Libertarians Are Idiots.
Date: 2012-08-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qbuDPO2LSX4
Description: Dusty Smith explains why Libertarianism is an ideology of suffering and death. I was much nicer than I could have been. I did not even attack the selfish Ayn Rand Libertarian cunt wing of the party, because I don't think most people who call themselves "Libertarians" even know about how these terrible ideas ever came to be in the first place. 

In my observation, most people who call themselves Libertarians really don't even know what the core Libertarian policies are. There are some good points to Libertarianism, but the bad outweighs the good so much that it's not even close. I shot an hours worth of footage and had so much to say about this, but i cut it down to 7 minutes. So I know I missed a ton of points, but you guys can discuss all that yourselves.

The shirt I am wearing is available at www.CultofDusty.com . We have a nice selection of Atheists Tees, so please support this channel and pick up one.

Title: Smoking Gun Evidence For Jesus!
Date: 2012-07-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eeWY3vJ1rIg

So in this video, I take an open minded look at this "evidence" to find out if Jesus really is lord.

Title: Fuck Israel!
Date: 2012-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=p153TH6P7sY
Description: The United States unquestioning support of Israel must end. The con job has gone on long enough. At some point we have to begin mocking our politician for being nothing more than sycophantic bitches of the Jewish lobby.

In hindsight, I should have left out the part about Israel taking 33% of foreign aid. It's a topic that would take its own video to explain properly. Going by the government's numbers it would appear that this is a false statement, but what the Government claims is not the whole story. There is a "real world" cost of things. The "real world" aid to Israel is actually much higher than the Governments public data indicates.

Lyrics!!!
you did it my friend! even with them all in your ear,
and sounding sincere, you realized they kept you with fear!
but something was wrong, for nothing you just couldn't believe
a god could sacrifice himself with good intentions indeed,
they told you don't look, but you knew there is more than this book
a whole world full of knowledge would take more than a look!
and you read it all, charles darwin plus others involved
that helped you overstand the fact that your community wrong
communion and all , for a god that's morally wrong
how could you sacrifice yourself for some people not born?
free as a bird , feel it when you relinquish the curse
of never getting all the credit but put make believe first,
out of the matrix, ironic how it feels so amazing
and you was taught your whole life, this the gateway to satan
don't believe it, cause i promise this the gateway to make it!
because you're steady doing work while everybody else praying
killing and shooting, kamikaze and burning up witches
so many religions , everybody is burning up bridges
in the name of what "god"? when he's acting like bitches
the greatest being of all times requires begging and wishes?
sacrifices on a mountain, think you're killing your children
right when you're ready, he laughs and says "i'm fuckin bullshitting"
narcissistic i don't get it , but they're thinking that's good
contradictions , wanna hear them , i don't mind if i would
eye for an eye , to me it means they fuckin with you
go fuck with them back, and get whatever they got from you
turn the other cheek , of course it means , they're fucking with you,
just leave them alone and let them keep what they got from you,
i'm really confused? if not, then this god is confused
perfect my ass, he doesn't even know what to do,
But men who fuck boys try to tell you it's true
don't believe them then convince you the problem is you.
they wanna kill a man who loves a man and tell you it's cool
cause Leviticus 20:13 gone tells them that it's true.
i say fuck em all and let you know i'm standing with you,
you're never alone as long as you're searching for truth!
throw up that "L" sign and grab your wine , we're toasting to knowledge
and surround yourself with atheists until the glass touches
on the count of 3 , what could we scream , i'm thinking of something?
oh i get it , ready Dusty................LOGIC!!!!

Title: Fuck Chuck Norris.
Date: 2012-01-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GdU0Ne3yrsQ
Description: In this video, Dusty explains exactly why Chuck Norris sucks and informs you of what you can do about it! 

I actually edited out the part of the video where I explained that those of us who are old enough to remember Chuck Norris from his movies know Chuck Norris memes are a joke, but the meme is so old now that there is a whole generation of young people who have no idea that Chuck Norris really wasn't a baddass. Most people are not in on the joke, and thus continuing to spread this meme only benefits Chuck Norris and gives him a platform for his awful causes. 

The sad thing is, I actually find many of the Chuck Norris memes to be hilarious. I just think they are wasted on Chuck Norris. How about Bruce Lee? 

Also, Just thought I'd point out that I don't actually think I could kick Chuck Norris's ass. According to my good friend Yves Edwards, who is a Legendary UFC fighter, Chuck Norris is a legit BJJ Black Belt and would kill me. So I guess that's probably true.

Title: Atheists Own The Internet!
Date: 2011-10-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_UdRM3skHSE
Description: Want proof that religion is dying? Look no further than the dominance of atheists on the Internet. We fucking own this place, and it's only matter of time before we mock faith into non-existence.

Title: We are the 99%
Date: 2011-10-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YxByvS5ZByM
Description: Since the beginning of human civilization, the few have ruled the many. This is the way it has always been, but is this the way it always has to be? Are we destined to be eternally ruled by the richest among us? Or can we evolve past this obviously outdated and primitive system? I believe the time has come for our society to evolve to the next level. The system is clearly not working for the vast majority of humans. It is time for us to become a very vocal majority and rise up against the oligarchy. If not now then when? And if not us then who? We are the ones we are waiting for, motherfuckers! Get off your asses and educated the masses!

Title: The Big Dick Theory
Date: 2011-10-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mZW-WHSh8ls
Description: Could our society's irrational obsession with giant penises lead to the unprecedented advancement of all mankind? The answer is a definite YES, and "The Big Dick Theory" explains exactly how! 

I almost called this video "Evolution For Stupid People" because although the ideas expressed here are absurd, they do explain nicely how evolution works in a way even the dumbest among us can understand. This video is meant to be biting social commentary on what I perceive as our society's ridiculous obsession with giant penises; but who am I really kidding. This is really just an excuse for me to tell a dick joke. Every great comedian of all time has done their take on the "dick joke", and this is mine. 

If you like my videos and want to support them, and also want to pick up your very own, hand painted "Sex Robot" T-shirt (literally hand painted in my house by a hot topless Asian girl) head on over to our webstore @ http://www.cultofdusty.com

Title: Do Not Join The Military!
Date: 2011-09-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vokvW-SXUnc
Description: Do not allow yourself to be meat for the meat grinder. Do not give your life away to make some rich asshole richer. Do not 

kill strangers because some incompetent pricks in Washington tell you it's the moral thing to do. The only way to win is to not play the game. 

It is time for the young people in this country to stop being part of America's war machine. It's obvious that our 

government has no intention of stopping these endless wars. The only logical thing left to do is to encourage our young people not to participate in this system.

Title: Fuck 9/11! Get Over It Already!
Date: 2011-09-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nAMlF3KO1vs
Description: Is America really the home of the brave? Or is it the home of cowardly little bitches who can't get over something that happened a decade ago? Anyone who has paid attention to our political system or our media over the last 10 year knows the answer to this. The American people have allowed the terrorists to win. No doubt about it. At some point, the nation has to stand up to the fear mongering, and say enough is enough already.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=t3fFZ8STBgI
Description: One of the most common arguments made by Christian is that "Atheists hate God and that's the reason they speak out against him." This is my counter to this argument. If you like it, feel free to send it to a Christian next time they say this silly shit to you.

Title: Bible Prophecies For DUMMIES
Date: 2011-07-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=F6LAKleHUr8
Description: In this video, I examine the most popular Bible prophecies in a way so simple that anyone can understand. Is there proof that the bible was inspired by God, or is it all just a load of obvious horseshit that even the dumbest humans on the planet should be able to see right through?

When I say "believe" I actually mean "feel it is more probably to be true than not based on the evidence I've seen." But that's way too long to say each time.

Description: Is Evolution a Religion? The Answer is YES, Evolution is a religion! Evolution is nothing more than a false religion that was create by Satan in order to deceive smart people into believing in facts and evidence instead of the Bible. 98.9% of Scientists in relevant fields have been fooled into believing evolution is true. Their faith has been tested and they have failed. Good luck burning in hell for eternity Scientists!

Title: Faith Is Death's Best Friend
Date: 2011-05-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9KwK-kqaDD0
Description: Bonus Video! This is footage that was edited out of my last video on the rapture. I felt that these points were too important to leave on the cutting room floor, so I made a separate little video out of them. Consider this a "bonus" video, and you didn't even have to buy the DVD to get it! 

Seriously though, I want to thank all of you for your immense support. Recently. I've noticed a lot of you sharing my videos on your facebook pages, as well as other atheist videos, and generally just being excellent spokes people for atheism. You people are changing the world. Your actions mean more than probably even you know. You guys make me optimistic about the future, and I sincerely thank you for that.

Description: Attention delusional nutbags! The Rapture is NEVER going to happen. You idiots have been spreading this nonsense for 2,000 years, and it's time for this childish bullshit to go extinct. Every Christian who believes in a Rapture is just as insane as Harold Camping and the people who follow him. 

FYI. Yes I know we are technically great apes and not monkeys, but great ape does not roll off the tongue and is not nearly as funny sounding. If it really bothers you, just pretend I said Ape.

Date: 2011-05-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VAro-d4y2Mw
Description: The religious have have been spreading their harmful dogmas unchecked for far too long. It is time for every thinking person to stand up and speak out. There is a revolution happening right now in this world. For the first time in history, we actually have the tools to counter the trillions of dollars of propaganda put out by theists. "Closet Atheists" need to get off the sidelines and into the game. The evolution of our society quite literally hangs in the balance, so what are you bitches waiting for?

Date: 2011-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OK3gaVYC-ZQ
Description: It's strange to live in such a phony society, where most of the people around me are pretending that they believe something that they clearly don't. Your actions show what you truly believe, and the actions of Christians show that they do not really care about what Jesus had to say.

Title: Easter Is Bullshit. The Bible Tells Me So
Date: 2011-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QzjXd5gTr0U
Description: According to Christians, an all powerful, all knowing God is incapable of having the details of his resurrection recorded the same way by 4 different people. Even though he supposedly inspired every word of it.

Date: 2011-03-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0fBlkeH0Bhw
Description: Want proof that Christianity is nothing more than a creepy cult? Look no further than the creepy ass rituals they participate in. 

I know people get all pissy when you call people "retarded", but I have never had a single retarded person message me and tell me it bothers them. It's always non-retarded people that it seems to upset. Retarded people don't mind when you call non-retarded people "retarded" because It makes them seem smarter by comparison.

Title: Christianity Harms Society. Why I Mock Christians
Date: 2011-03-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IlXkjrluq_4
Description: What kind of nation do you get when 8 our of every 10 people believe in fairy tales as if they were reality? You get a nation that puts more people in prison than any other nation in the world. You get a nation that rewards the people who crashed the global economy by giving them hundreds of millions in bonuses. You get a nation were harmless plants are made illegal while drugs like tobacco and alcohol, which kill millions yearly, are perfectly fine. It gives you a nation with more than 18 million empty houses that we won't allow people to live in. 

In short, you get a retarded nation. But not everyone is willing to sit idly by and do nothing. Some of us want change. For all you atheists who think we should just leave Christians alone and let them believe whatever they want, shame on you. You are part of the problem. You are either too naive to see the harm these fairy tale believing idiots are causing our society, or you are too cowardly to do anything about it. Either way, you disgust me.

Date: 2011-03-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=APb3l4mCtpo
Description: In this video I kick Pascal's Wager in the balls and one up him with my own wager. Dusty's Wager should be used to crush any moron who uses Pascal's Wager to justify their belief in primitive, idiotic fairytales.

Title: You DO NOT Have A Personal Relationship With Jesus Christ
Date: 2011-02-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=DtrE5RBB2gk
Description: Almost daily some moron tells me that the reason they know the Bible is true for a 100% fact is because they have a "personal relationship with Jesus Christ". I'm gonna have to go ahead and call bullshit on this one. I know Christians love to parrot stupid shit they've heard others say, like how their God is a "Living God" (if he is alive, where the fuck is he at? Introduce me!) or how humans have been "Fearfully and Wonderfully made" (why does everything revolve around fear with you people?) 

However, at some point, you just have to stand up and point out to them that there "Christian Catch Phrases" are nothing more than mindless gibberish that doesn't mean anything. Just like the entirety of their religion. 

"Fictitional" is a real word in my crazy made up space language. It means "More fictional than normal fiction". It's a whole nother level passed basic fiction, and off into the realm of extreme stupidity.

Date: 2010-11-05

Description: I think we can all agree that it sucks that every man has to toil in the fields and every woman has to go through incredible pain during child birth, simply because Adam ate that apple. But before we blame him too much, let's put ourselves in his shoes and see it from his point of view.

Title: Why Do Churches Need Tax Exempt Status?
Date: 2010-06-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AUmpW1jj-wA
Description: Hello, My name is Dusty Smith, and I would like to be the first openly Atheist president of the United States. 

Isn't it time that the leader of the free world was guided by logic and reason instead of superstition and fairy tales? Isn't it time we had a president that understands the difference between "primitive myths" and "scientific reality"? I know it sounds like a crazy idea, but then again... maybe it's just crazy enough to work! 

I just turned 35, and now that I am legally old enough to run for president, I thought I should go ahead and get started. After all, it may take a very, VERY long time for an openly Atheist person to get into the White house. But I figure that with modern medical technology, I will probably live to be at least 135. So that gives me another 100 years to run for president. 

And believe me, a WHOLE lot of shit can change in 100 years! 

Abut this video: I find that the constitution is a lot like the Bible. It can be interpreted a lot of different ways. In this video, I explain my interpretation of the Establishment Claus and how I will enforce it if I'm elected president.

Title: Tales From The Church - True Crazy Christian Stories
Date: 2010-04-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Y-NNbml3kxo
Description: When I was a kid, I saw all kinds of crazy bullshit at Church. In this video, I share my kooky experiences and at the same time give Christians the greatest news in the world! 

My grandmother disowning me last week really fucked with my head and made me not want to do videos anymore. She was the last person on earth I ever thought would turn her back on me. It really broke my heart and caused me to behave in a way I never have before. It made me want to stop making videos because these videos really have cost me the majority of my family. People really have no idea what I sacrifice just to do this. 

But that whiny quitter guy is not me and my moment of weakness only lasted about 3 days. I'm actually kinda embarrassed about the whole thing, but in a way I'm glad it happened. Because it showed me who my true friends and family are. I got so much support and love from my Youtube family, that I am ashamed I ever considered leaving to begin with. 

Well fear not. I'm not going anywhere. As long as you guys are here, I will be here. Thank you all very much for being there for me when I needed you.

Title: God Does Not Need Your Help
Date: 2010-02-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ttaq39-4yCs
Description: As a child I always wondered why an all powerful, all knowing God would need the help of puny, little humans? This makes absolutely no logical sense at all, and even little kids can see how ridiculous this claim is. 

But this is in fact what Christianity, Islam, and most other religions claim. They claim that an all powerful God , for some reason, needs their help to spread his word. God needs their help to fight wars in his name. God needs their help to protest abortion clinics and other causes in his name. 

The insanity of this belief is obvious to anyone who just thinks about this logically for just a few seconds. Why would this infinite, all powerful God need you for anything? It is just silly. God does not need your help. If he did, he wouldn't be God.

Title: Dusty Bitchslaps Muslim Fundies
Date: 2010-02-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JGmapi4N-eM
Description: With Google's recent saber rattling against China over internet censorship, it makes their actions of removing Youtube videos all the more hypocritical. This video is a perfect example of free speech. I am not advocating violence against anyone. I am simply making jokes with a mixture of hardcore truth thrown in. So will Google censor me by taking this video down? And if they do, how does that make them any better than China? 

My gut tells me that Googles really doesn't care about Freedom of Speech and Censorship as much as they pretend. My gut tells me that they will remove this video just as surely as the Government of China would remove any truth said about them. I hope I am wrong. 

But in case I'm not, please mirror this video as many places as you can. And if they do remove this, I hope you will all join together with me and help me fight the ridiculous and hypocritical censorship that is taking place right here on Youtube. 

If someone says something that someone else doesn't like, that person simply doesn't have to watch the video. They can turn it off. But this doesn't seem to be enough. Not only do they not want to see it themselves, but they want to make sure that no one else sees it either; and Google seems all too willing to oblige these free Speech haters. 

As long as you are not inciting violence, you should be allowed to say whatever you want. That's what free speech is all about. Either Google believes in free speech and a total lack of censorship, or they don't. If this video gets removed, their actions will prove their true feelings on this matter.

Description: Anyone who has ever spent any time debating a Christian has learned one thing for sure, when it comes to the Old Testament, Christians are embarrassed as fuck by it. They will go to amazing feats of mental gymnastics just to explain it all away, like it was all just some sort of bad dream. 

"Don't worry! The Old Testament no longer counts. God called for a "do over". He changed his mind!" 

It really is like a bunch of eight year olds playing make believe in their backyard. 

P.S. Could I say the words "Old Testament" more?

Title: If 9/11 Was An Inside Job, It Doesn't Matter
Date: 2009-12-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Lh-8MwFdJlY
Description: Your time is valuable. Why waste it with conspiracy theories that may or may not be true? The fact of the matter is, you can't do shit about it. So why worry about it? Just enjoy your life and focus on the things you really can change. 

Besides, all conspiracy theories will do is make you paranoid. It does not benefit your life. They still haven't done anything about John F,Kennedy's death yet. You really think anything will ever be done if 9/11 really were a big conspiracy? Of course not. Be logical.

Title: Faith Is Retarded - In HD - Funny Video Mocking the Delusional
Date: 2009-05-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ociVKTytElw
Description: What do Kirk Cameron, Jesus Christ, and the Special Olympics have to do with one another? 

Clearly Christianity, as with all religions, has been a necessary cog in the machinery of evolution. But it is a crutch that we no longer need. It is time for us to move past this primitive mindset and into a world based on reason and logic. 

In order to make this transition, we are going to need interpreters who can translate things into the simplest possible terms so that the masses can properly understand more advanced concepts. Unfortunatly, our society has been fed a diet of fast food and television for so long that any concept we need them to understand is going to have to be broken down into the lowest common denominator. 

Which brings me to this video "Faith Is Retarded". It's a crude way to put it, but it is something that everyone, even those who refuse to believe it, can at least grasp. I would much rather have an intellectual debate with theist based on facts, logic, and reason; but it is clear to me that the faithful have no interest at all in this. They take pride in ignorance. They consider it a badge of honor, and they honestly believe that the more they believe in fairy tales, the more they will be rewarded for it. 

In an ideal world, we could just leave these people be; but the fact that they use their delusions to force a bronze age mythology on the rest of us makes this impossible. These people have given us things like 8 years of George Bush and Prop 8. They deny the mountain of amount of evidence that says we are killing our host planet, and they are actively and gleefully trying to bring about Armageddon so that their messiah can return. Ignoring them is no longer an option. 

So what do you do when 5 out of every 6 people on earth are involved in some sort of cult based on primitive fairytales? What do you do when they stick their heads in the sand and ignore the men who have doubled the life expectancy of every single one of them? It seems to me that there is only one peaceful solution.... mocking. 

Because no one wants to be on the same side as the laughing stocks. Especially the youth. So I say we mock and ridicule them mercilessly. We expose them for the laughable dullards they are at every turn. And then we invite their children to the cool kids party. It may take a generation or two, but eventually those that refuse to evolve will become extinct, and the curse of faith will finally be broken.
