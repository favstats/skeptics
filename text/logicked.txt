Title: Re: Amos Yee on Pedophilia
Date: 2017-11-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=U3k0m8QUFws
Description: I meant to do one last video on Amos Yee after he was released, and this gave me a good reason. This is a lot different from usual, so I hope you‚Äôll indulge my venting just this once. Hopefully you find something of value in it so it's more than just catharsis for me. Thanks for listening as I close the lid on this issue for good.
For the first time maybe ever, I‚Äôm not linking the original video. You can find it easily yourself if you want to.

Title: In which they don‚Äôt understand...anything (Missing the Mark and Deflating Atheism Part 3)
Date: 2017-11-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bk2JCJqmnIE
Description: Two crazy Christians march around receiving transmissions through the cereal bowls on their ears. Or something.

Unstated in the video: "Reversing the velocity" refers to changing "t" (time) in d/t (velocity) to -t, hence "time reversal". Changing t to -t affects more than just velocity, but velocity gets the point across easiest. And "all atoms in the egg" is a simplification, since the velocities of all relevant objects in the system would need to be reversed - the floor, the air, etc. and not just the egg. But you get the idea.

Title: Skeptics Paradise: Logicked vs Armoured Skeptic (Diss Track) (Guest Video: Poisoning the Well)
Date: 2016-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ueMQ8rtuJrs
Description: SUBSCRIBE TO POISONING THE WELL: https://www.youtube.com/user/zombiewerewolfproduc

The day of reckoning is at hand. Poisoning the Well was given two months to complete a guest video for Logicked‚Äôs channel. PhatPat and So Fain wanted to deliver something smart and funny to satisfy the more sophisticated tastes of Logicked‚Äôs subscriber base. The unfortunate truth is, however, that this simply isn‚Äôt something they can do. Instead, they took inspiration from Keemstar and Ricegum and decided to kick off the ultimate drama...

It‚Äôs time for the battle between Logicked and Armoured Skeptic to begin. PTW would rather tear the skeptic community apart than accept the fact that they simply aren‚Äôt up to the challenge of doing a serious debunk. Let it burn! And there is no better way to start this drama than with YouTube‚Äôs favorite weapon... The Diss Track.

Note from Logicked: Thanks Pragma First for making this point. It's something I noticed when I put out my recent video on Christianity, and was swarmed with angry Christians telling me "Why are you wasting time on us? Go back to Islam and SJWs." They see that we're distracted, and they're using the lack of criticism as much as they can, while shaming us for being irresponsible and ignoring "real issues" when we step out of line.

Sheikh Hussain Yee explains to us why the washroom is so important in Islam, and why Muslims should (and also shouldn't) be treated unequally based on stereotypes.

Here is the video response I promised. Adam Saleh, perhaps the biggest dickhead and dunce on YouTube, has called Amos Yee racist for mocking Islam, and sent his 1.1 million subscribers to report Amos's video in an attempt to silence him. The video has now been swarmed with Muslims issuing threats, calls for the video to be taken down, and claims to have reported it. You may recall from my last video that Amos Yee will probably serve between 18 months and 3 years in prison for mocking Islam and Christianity on YouTube and other social media. Adam Saleh and his followers can suck the free world's balls.

By the way, the terrible cuts at the end of his clips are just how he edits his videos. Yeah, I was surprised too.

Not my usual kind of video, but this is more important than what I normally do. I spent most of my YouTube time this month getting some channel/production upgrades arranged (some of which will appear soon, others of which are behind-the-scenes and invisible).

And yes, I'm skeptical of his story as well, since it sounds like every Christian testimonial I've ever heard.

Kent explains to his conservative Christian audience why evolutionists are all evil mega-Hitlers who love aborting babies because they're just fish.

I cover approximately minutes 73-75 of the 110-minute "100 Reasons Evolution is So Stupid!". Geology.

The title is the magnificent opening line of Kent's first doctoral dissertation, my favourite document in the history of ever: https://file.wikileaks.org/file/kent-hovind-doctoral-dissertation.pdf

In this video, Kent disagrees with his own reasons for rejecting carbon dating.
I choked myself with my top button because my neck is too fat. Gonna have to fix that, but for now I just said fuck the button and the tie, goddammit. So the lights on either side of my shirt kind of make it look like I have cleavage. Oh, if only. I'd motorboat myself every day.

Responding to the article "How Studying Science Strengthened My Faith" by Samita Sarkar. These are some very silly claims about how science lines up with the true religion of Hinduism.
Someone send this to Jerry Coyne. I found the article through https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/puffho-touts-syncretism-a-particularly-loopy-form-of-accommodationism/
...and why is everyone reading "digestion" and understanding "cellular respiration"? I get that she basically described cellular respiration, but she SAID digestion.

I can't believe he stands by this video enough to reupload it a year later, but apparently he does, so now it's my turn to talk about it, and the oppressed penis holder Isethoriginal shows up for a few seconds to mansplain something to Steve. What a backwards world.

New sign coming soon from LA Metro:
"Respect our white passengers. Please refrain from the following actions: Doing drugs. Dealing drugs. Fighting. Stealing. Pulling knives. Getting all up in people's faces. Rapping. These actions contribute to violence against white people."
To the people defending the sign in the video: You'd have no problem with such a sign as long as the numbers showed that black people were responsible for more of those actions, would you? Personally, I find such a sign racist and stupid, and I don't think the government should pay to have it installed. Why? Because I'm not a racist.

Super rushed video. Pretty serious this time. I've sent this to PZ, so I kept it very civil to try to reach him. I actually think it might be possible, but not without a bit of an olive branch. I know you're still in there, PZ.
Oh, and to clarify, I scroll right to the science and atheism parts on that site. The rest of it is shrieking hysteria. I'd be surprised if PZ doesn't faint on a daily basis. But there's no reason to be uncivil for this.

None of this should need to be said, but nowadays it does. I won't bother mentioning which bigoted attention-horse prompted this. I'm sure most of you have heard similar arguments before, though. They're pretty common these days in response to the criticism of one particular very widespread ideology which I have criticized previously. So I thought I'd put in my two cents.
Read the article. There isn't much to actually debunk. It says it's about scientific reasons, but instead it's just some new religious beliefs smeared all over some old religious beliefs, without even an attempt to present evidence. http://desinema.com/hindu-traditions-scientific-reasons/

Date: 2014-08-18

Description: In this video, the preeminent scientific genius of the modern era tells us that the sun is the universe, shares with us an engaging intellectual discourse he once had in the bathroom mirror with the highly qualified Berkeley cosmologist Dr. Kent Hovind, then explains why evolution and watching YouTube videos are religions.

I cover approximately minutes 8.5 - 21 of the 110-minute "100 Reasons Evolution is So Stupid!". Big Bang, evolution as a religion, and Kent's imaginary friend (for once, not God).

Title: Hello, My Name is Kent Hovind 1: Hi, Dr. Kent!
Date: 2014-04-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uUEusDsR61k
Description: In this video, some two-bit John Morris Pendleton wannabe tells us that he thinks he uses stupid definitions of "evolution", then complains about some crappy old textbooks for a while.

I cover approximately the first 8.5 minutes of the 110-minute "100 Reasons Evolution is So Stupid!". Introductions, definitions, and some Big Bang discussion.

The title is the magnificent opening line of Kent's first doctoral dissertation, my favourite document in the history of ever: https://file.wikileaks.org/file/kent-hovind-doctoral-dissertation.pdf

This is "the big video" I mentioned a while back. But it's coming out in chunks, because "big" meant "BIG". Consider the length of this video compared to the amount of Hovind material covered, and then consider that Hovind's original video is almost two hours long. I was going to make one video, but when I realized it would be six hours long, I decided to make it a series instead.

Title: Evolution: A Graveyard Smash
Date: 2013-11-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pMvI-aQRSxg
Description: The funniest video ever, and not because of me.

A Ra worshipper (or something?) argues with me about the conclusionary nature of thought concerning evolutionary claim.

I highly recommend watching Boris's full original video, because I left out a good ten minutes of insane, hilarious preaching that was repetitive and not really worthy of discussion and such.
Video is used under fair use for purposes of commentary, criticism, and satire.

This guy sets off my poe alarm, but he's made almost two hundred videos over two years, so either he's real or he's a poe so dedicated that he deserves the attention anyway. Plus, this video was a whole lot of fun to make.

Really, there's nothing at all important here, and I admit I half-assed it a little. You can tell by my disheveled appearance in the first half.

Title: Hello, I'm a Scientist 13: Goodnight, Zacatecas
Date: 2013-10-16

Description: It certainly does create a strong feeling of trust when someone says "Hello, I'm a scientist". This is why we should automatically believe everything "Chemist"/"Scientist"/"Professor"/"Midhusband"/"Father of eight"/"Happily married man"/Auto Mechanic John Morris Pendleton says. This time, he makes a thoroughly convincing and honest case to prove that Nessie is a real live dinosaur that lives in Scotland, England. And John and I part ways.

I may just be tired but I think I may have synched the audio and video somewhat poorly. But there's no way I'm re-rendering it now...compensate for it in your brain. For some reason, the last several episodes of this series have been extremely hard to film and edit, while the episodes of Science in the 12th Century have been easy and fun. Maybe that's my mind telling me something.

This is why we should automatically believe everything "Chemist"/"Scientist"/"Professor"/"Midhusband"/"Father of eight"/"Happily married man"/Auto Mechanic John Morris Pendleton says. This time, he makes a thoroughly convincing and honest case to prove that fish float eternally on the water's surface once they die, and Bacteria Barbie and Pete got bigger because they were sad about being small :'(

Title: Deutschbag vs. Douchebag - Christian vs. Atheist
Date: 2013-06-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=97IM7ZXMZyU
Description: I talk to a Christian who totally knows what atheists are all about.

This is a project I undertook mainly as part of my new effort to learn to read and comprehend German. Kaiser Prussotroll helped a lot with figuring out the parts I couldn't, fixing up grammatical misunderstandings, proofreading, contextualizing, and generally just making this possible. So yeah, he's awesome.

Since I don't understand German very well at all yet, I didn't know the details of what this video was about until I started the translation process. I decided to do it based solely on the awesome undershirt and the awkward camera changes (which are mostly edited out here; see the original video). It was an alright choice...Siegfried isn't American-fundie-crazy, but kind of a subtle dick, so I don't feel too bad being kind of a less-than-subtle dick.

Since this is a translation, I've tried to stay away from criticising specific phrasing too often, but sometimes you just have to assume you got it right and move forward. Also, we tried to make the English as true to the spirit of the original German as possible, but if there are discrepancies, keep in mind that it's only the English version that I'm responding to.

Adding a note for people who don't get sarcasm, whether they're not familiar enough with American English or for whatever other reason: The intro ridicules MY OWN CULTURE, not THE GERMAN LANGUAGE. -2014/02/02

Description: It certainly does create a strong feeling of trust when someone says "Hello, I'm a scientist". This is why we should automatically believe everything "Chemist"/"Scientist"/"Professor"/Auto Mechanic John Morris Pendleton says. This time, he makes a thoroughly convincing and honest case to prove that the Grand Canyon was carved in a week by the flood...no wait, a spilled lake...no wait, the flood. And also that anything can be explained away by dropping mud on it.

I said 3.6 when I meant 3.36 :( Woe!
Also, passing through the firmament (which John thinks started the flood) would affect the object. Probably it would slow it down slightly and not much else, although I'll leave those calculations to you.

If you can't read the comments thread at the start, up the quality to 720 or 1080 for that part.

Hello, future people who don't remember the date of it: The event he refers to was Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut.

This was on our video list for Wacky World of Worshipers over at AtheismTV. I find it pretty hard to make fun of without vomiting, so I thought I'd upload it here for now. This way, I won't have to grab it from archive.org if I ever use it. I don't know what it's really called or who made it. If you want to hear some seriously dark, sickening indoctrination, give it a watch. By the way, if you find any more of this type of stuff, let me know. I'm a fan.

Title: Hello, I'm a Scientist 2: DINOSAURS Prove Creation!
Date: 2012-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=03V4ol3KLY4
Description: It certainly does create a strong feeling of trust when someone on TV or in a video says "Hello, I'm a doctor" or "Hello, I'm a scientist". This is why we should automatically believe everything Chemist (and now full-rank SCIENTIST!) John Morris Pendleton says. He makes a thoroughly convincing and honest case for vegetarian dinosaurs and the "old lizard" theory, as well as an airtight case for a large-scale scientific conspiracy.

Of course, I'm being completely sarcastic.

Description: As promised in my video Hello, I'm A Scientist Part 2, here is a look at the book left uncited by Chemist John Morris Pendleton. He claimed that living trees were found to be over 10,000 years old using carbon-14 dating, and that the dating method therefore does not work. Let's see about that.
