Title: The Repugnant Conclusion

This video explores and tries to explain the philosophical theory of The Repugnant Conclusion. It states that one can make a convincing argument for why a huge miserable population is better than a small happy one. It was inspired by the writings of Jonathan Spelman and Derek Parfit. I hope you find it interesting.

I'm back! With a nice historical documentary about The Battle of the Bulge! Thank you for looking out for me! You're the best! 

To many, the very mention of The Battle of the Bulge, also known as The Battle of The Ardennes, conjures up bleak images of desperate soldiers trying to fight off starvation and hypothermia, while simultaneously facing the onslaught of a merciless and relentless enemy, regardless of which side they were on. It was, to put it mildly, a hellish and miserable existence, the likes of which few people in our modern time can even begin to understand. It was a battle of both enormous strategic and symbolic value and one which is remembered in history due largely to its raw ferocity. To be sure, it was but one of many such battles which helped decide the fate of the world to come, but today we focus on this one; This one epic tale of massive armies clashing head on, in the very heart of Europe.

►You're free to use this animation in your own videos if you leave a link to my channel in your description. (In other words, you can cut the text at the end, provided you leave a link in the description.)

So apparently Cosplay needs safe spaces, and showing appreciation for black characters is racist. Furthermore, this girl has appointed herself the spokesperson for black people, because white people talk too much. Kafkaesque isn't it? Enjoy!

Oh, and don't forget to tweet me pictures of you wearing the T-shirt if you want to be in a future video!

Description: I'm currently totally swamped with work here, so once again I've gotten some help from my good buddy Dave from Computing Forever. Today he's here to rebut Thunderf00t's video about #Brexit. Now don't get him/us wrong here. Neither me nor Dave have a problem with Thunderf00t. In fact, we love the guy and really enjoy his videos. BUT, in this instance we both felt he was way off, and could use some constructive criticism. :) So, ENJOY!

(Please note: This video is not meant to create any drama, or in any way attack Thunderf00t as a person. We'd like to believe that people can sometimes disagree but still remain on good terms. It's simply a counter-argument being put forth while there's still time. In about a week we'll have the answer.)

I had this little video commissioned so that I have something appropriate to cut to when a moron makes a particularly stupid Straw Man argument. Just thought I'd upload the whole thing in its entirety here, before I start using parts of it in a video. It also gets you a chance to discover the multi-talented SunBunz. :) Enjoy!

So I figured I'd bring you a video to help pass the time as you await the stroke of midnight. It's of a girl who can't figure out why people hate feminism so much, especially in the light of feminism helping men so much... (by helping feminist, of course.) Yeah, her logic is loopy, to say the least. :)

As for the rest of the video, it has a little bit of everything: a mindless drone feminist, doublethink, stupidity, racial confusion, and of course absolute cringe when she drags her "boifriend" [sic] on screen. :)

A request. Don't know how to categorize this chick. It's not about feminism, and it's not about social justice. She does reveal that she's very religious, but that's not really what this video is about, so it's not really a true "This is your brain on Religion" video either. She's just a through-and-though bimbo moron. A bimbo with 2,000,000 subscribers and a book publishing deal. Is she a troll? Who cares! It really doesn't matter when you have 2 million subs; She must be opposed either way. What is the world coming to? 
Yeah yeah, I know this video will probably lose me a couple subscribers, but sometimes I just gotta have some fun. Know what I mean? :)

As you probably remember, a little over a month ago I did a video on a special snowflake named JJTalkz who doesn't believe that biological sex exists. Well, guess what! The queen bitch of the Alien Hive, Laci Green, has since chimed in on the subject. She doesn't believe in biological sex either. With "sex educators" like this, is it any wonder our world is going to hell?

I think we've found the guy who's making feminists go apeshit. An honest-to-god [pun intended] misogynist. This is the guy who makes it so hard for legitimate MRAs to make their voices heard when speaking up on issues such as the high level of male suicide, male genital mutilation and other issues that actually deserve some recognition.

Description: So I wanted to make a little video about people being "offended". People sometimes say to me "What if you offend someone?" It's utterly stupid to spend time on such a useless feeling, and I'm not going to restrict my ideas or videos just because it might offend someone. And I'm sure that'll make most of you happy. :)

The more I thought about it, the more I realized that Steve Hughes had already made an awesome video on this. And since I can't just upload a video without adding a lot of commentary to it and still be in good standing in terms of copyright, I figured I would just do my own tribute version and include a link! Enjoy!

OMG! Remember how feminist have talked about consent laws? There really is no way to make these people happy! Do what they want and they still lose their shit! So I guess the only way left is to videotape all sex. Suck on that! :) That's not a society I want to live in!

Vegan Hitler wants all meat-eaters to die. So I guess I just have to coin a new term: Vegan-Nazism. Seeing as how Hitler actually was a vegetarian, it's kind of scary. Why are every group proponents of genocide these days? Stop the jihad, start the love!

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2oPIOPnQaYU
Description: We all know that feminists (and feminism) think all men are rapists, but it still surprises me every time I see it in writing. What's also surprising is how they can preach for the liberation of women, while at the same time denying women the right to think for themselves. Add to that, their proclivity for wanting to be able to prosecute thought-crime, and you have a perfect trifecta.
