Title: Refuting Islam With Their Own Quran #FreeAmos
Date: 2016-06-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-v-A0p0_X3A
Description: This kid is a fucking hero, subscribe to him here: https://www.youtube.com/user/BrainAndButter

Adam Saleh, perhaps the biggest dickhead and dunce on YouTube, has called Amos Yee racist for mocking Islam, and sent his 1.1 million subscribers to report Amos's video in an attempt to silence him. The video has now been swarmed with Muslims issuing threats, calls for the video to be taken down, and claims to have reported it. You may recall that Amos Yee will probably serve between 18 months and 3 years in prison for mocking Islam and Christianity on YouTube and other social media. Adam Saleh's new affront to free speech will not stand. This is the UNCENSORED version of Amos's video which does not currently exist on his channel. MIRROR IT EVERYWHERE. THUMB UP AMOS YEE'S VIDEO. THUMB DOWN ADAM SALEH'S VIDEO. Adam Saleh and his followers can suck the free world's balls.

Title: This Week in Stupid (22/05/2016)
Date: 2016-05-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nyDIrnbI7rg
Description: "You are on the wrong side of history." - Regressive diversity activists.

UPDATE: The British media mis-reported this as Trudeau manhandling the whip out of anger, and failed to mention that the people Trudeau barged through were actively blocking his path. 

My objection was Trudeau manhandling a peer in parliament, but this isn't what happened, so my apologies and I retract my statements about him. Although it's still pointless to apologise for something you didn't do and someone else already apologised for.

UPDATE #2: Davpe357 1 hour ago
+Sargon of Akkad Sorry about this Sargon but I checked out the site reporting about "Nordic alcohol culture" in Sweden and that the police should have used this as a way to cover up (or downplay) sexual assault by immigrants and the source is pure propaganda (Fria tider is the one I read). What the appendix in the police report says is that it is both Nordic alcohol culture and non-traditional gender roles which is to blame for the high number of sexual assaults, but that's it. The report does not in any way say that the Swedish alcohol culture makes immigrants rape and doesn't use this as an excuse to sweep sexual assaults by immigrants under the rug. The "journalist" that wrote the article have simply twisted the words of the report to make it seem like the police is trying to do some kind of cover up which is not the case. In fact, the report is very open about problems with immigrants and assaults, to give you an example: they are very clear that immigrants are the problem when it comes to sexual assaults in bath houses. 

The "journalist" also has a hard time understanding the references in the annex since the comments about the "Nordic alcohol culture" comes from an interview related to the FRA report, not the FRA report itself which they seem to believe. This is referenced in the footnote. 

I am all against the regressive left but this article is pure right wing propaganda and in my opinion you should make an update were you let people know that this is the case (just like you updated the Trudeau story in your comment). You might also want to fact check articles from "Fria tider" in the future since they are quite biased in their reporting. 

Many thanks, Davpe357.

Title: The 2015 New Years Eve Attacks in #Cologne (#K�
Date: 2016-01-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WJCLSZm4-LA
Description: UPDATE: the clip of Merkel saying "refugees are more criminal" is indeed taken out of context and is from 2011. Thanks to those who informed me of this. 

Initial reports suggest that there were indeed migrants involved in the 2015 New Year's Eve attacks in Cologne and there was also a corresponding effort by politicians, police officials and the media to downplay if not outright cover-up of migrant involvement in what is, by feminist standards, a rape culture.

UPDATE: I should not have taken the Telegraph's interpretation of the Investigatory Powers Bill. They said: "In urgent circumstances, Mrs May or another Secretary of State would be able to issue a warrant without judicial authority" whereas the bill actually says: "In an emergency, powers can be authorised orally by the Secretary of State, and reviewed by a Judicial Commissioner who will have the power to quash a warrant."

The Telegraph's statement made it sound as if there was no judicial oversight, whereas upon checking the actual bill it turns out that this isn't the case. The mistake is mine, I should have checked the original document instead of taking their word for it.

Description: If someone in a hashtag movement disagrees with you, discuss the issue with them. When you find you cannot change your own mind or persuade them to change theirs, continue on a year-long war of attrition until one of you quits the movement. 

Oh wait, that's what an idiot would do. Do the smart thing and simply accept your differences and ignore each other.

When discussing religion, there is no need to mention them, basically.

Title: Herostratic Fame and the #UCCShooting
Date: 2015-10-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7K16xG7EtB0
Description: Chris Harper Mercer blogged about how "people like him [Vester Flanagan] are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are".

This hints of his motivation for his killing spree, a motivation that dates back to the burning of the Temple of Artemis by Herostratus in a bid to have his name enshrined in history.

Title: Chairman Pao and the Ministry of Truth
Date: 2015-08-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bDyCMGEN_As
Description: How Ellen Pao caused the #RedditRevolt and exposed feminist Minitrue outlets altering Party history. 

Update #1: r/fatpeoplehate/ was known for harassment and doxing: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/39bzdf/why_was_rfatpeoplehate_along_with_several_other/

Update #2: the firing of Taylor was certainly a huge cause for #RedditRevolt, apparently more than censorship: https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/

Update #3: The anti-censorship backlash occurred before the firing of Taylor. Sorry for these mistakes, it's tough understanding social events like these from the outside looking in. I suddenly understand why #GamerGate is so difficult to understand.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1OnWv0F8y6o
Description: As we draw closer to the 1 year anniversary of #GamerGate, I thought we should all take a moment to reflect on how this little hashtag broke the internet. Aside from generating over 7 million tweets from thousands of people all around the world, it also got name dropped in the wild, and it even got its own Law and Order SVU episode. And you better believe that it's so bad it's good.

Title: Egalitarianism as Interpreted by a Feminist
Date: 2015-07-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=seq7EYDyIGE
Description: The fallacies fly thick and fast as a feminist ideologue attempts to explain why egalitarianism is not a superior moral framework to feminism. 

Update: Mike has responded very maturely here: https://twitter.com/mikerugnetta/status/621045053490917376

Note: MIke's wonderful "explanation of egalitarianism" here, and it is just as misapprehended as his video: http://mikerugnetta.tumblr.com/post/123744373585/op-onions-pretty-disappointed-with-idea-channel

"As far as I understand it, the general principle of egalitarianism is “equality”. That all people should be treated as equals regardless of their race, gender, socio-economic status, and so on. This is awesome! And great! There is no shortage of people who agree. I agree! The question then becomes How does egalitarianism seek to accomplish this very lofty goal?"

By people treating each other as equals, Mike. It's that simple.

Title: Okinawa: America's Japanese Colony
Date: 2015-06-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8HZdVDTN_2Q

The damage this has done to the ecosystem and people of Okinawa is manifest, and the Okinawans are pushing to have the US military presence removed from their island altogether.

Title: The #Grexit Crisis
Date: 2015-06-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=esBrbxRsV6c
Description: The looming spectre of the Greek withdrawal from the Eurozone, known colloquially as the "Grexit", is setting alarm bells off across the continent. 

Syriza, the extreme-left Marxist coalition governing Greece will not abide further austerity measures, which are the demands of the EU and IMF before further bailout money will be released. 

Greece finds itself precariously teetering on default from repayment of IMF and ECB loans, practically bankrupt, with no further money coming...at least not from Europe. 

Outside of Europe, the Russian-led BRICS New Development Bank stands waiting in the wings to bail Greece out.

Needless to say, this is a geopolitical crisis for Europe.

The fourth reason people hate feminism is because gender studies degrees are indoctrination camps for insane, paranoid feminists, as evidenced by the fact they are now consuming themselves.

Title: Hipster Racists

Description: Progressive hipsters have decided that "racism" is no longer a concept but a "structure" or "system" as a rationalisation to see racism against non-white people everywhere or in turn be prejudiced against white people.

Which, incidentally, is exactly the opposite of what Martin Luther King Jr wanted, but I'm sure they know better than he does.

Date: 2015-05-19

Description: Eron Gjoni, author of the Zoe Post that kick-started #GamerGate, is mounting a legal challenge to the gag order Zoe Quinn had placed on him to prevent him speaking in his own defence. 

He requires $15,000 to cover legal fees to be able to prosecute his case, and I think it is in #GamerGate's best interests - and the interests of anyone who is anti-censorship - to support him.

Title: The British Crusade Against Slavery
Date: 2015-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_NoWIZv96KU
Description: The reason that slavery isn't acceptable anywhere in the modern world is because of the British people's 60-year crusade against it.

"The spirit of liberty is so deeply ingrained in our constitution that a slave, the moment he lands in England, is free."
Sir William Blackstone

"As soon as a person set foot on English soil, he or she becomes free."
Lord Henley

"As soon as a negro comes to England he is free."
Judge Holt

Description: We don't live in a meritocracy, we live in a white supremacist patriarchy. To fix this, white men must dedicate their lives to advancing the women they compete against. 

This does not count as privilege, just so we are clear.

Description: [Skip to 6:56 if you do not want to listen to Quinn's congressional briefing]

The facts completely debunk the social justice warrior narrative of #GamerGate. Too many sites have updated their ethics policies, too many pro-#GamerGate people have been attacked - even people who aren't #GamerGate but sound like they might be have been harassed by social justice warriors. 

Anita, Brianna, Zoe...they were harassed long before GamerGate and will likely be harassed afterwards. In other words, their harassment is a separate issue.

Title: The @Independent Publishes Fascist Propaganda
Date: 2015-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NXstvJPhCMQ
Description: The Independent newspaper published an op-ed that is little more than Nazi methodology repurposed for modern progressive politics.

I am thunderstruck anyone at the Independent thought this was acceptable, and then to pull it down 1984-style without printing a retraction is the icing on the cake.

Title: Feminism is the Establishment
Date: 2015-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9KASgSBfY1k
Description: Feminists now have to defend their choke-hold on the British establishment from attacks from the real world and people who are suffering the consequences of their unbridled selfishness. 

Not satisfied with feminists in every political party, feminist domination of academia and young women now out-earning young men, feminists insist that the skyrocketing male suicide rate is their own fault.

Description: Jack Thompson and Anita Sarkeesian use the same argument for censorship of video games for different reasons, and the evidence shows the argument is wrong. 

The response to both from the gaming community has been almost identical in each case.

It's important to note that Thompson claims he only wanted to ban violent video games for under-18s:

Title: Why Gamers Had To Die: Part 2 - The Industry Must Change For Diversity
Date: 2014-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GOt-YZ_i0Fk
Description: Adrienne Shaw reveals that her work is politically and ideologically driven. 

She comes to the conclusion that not only do gamers need to change but the entire industry needs to change because the free market has a natural mechanism for coping with demand - a "plurality of markets" - and this is, for some reason, a bad thing. 

As always, my thanks to Kerberos and Phil Shill for all their help researching this.

Title: Rape Culture UK
Date: 2014-11-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OB6zMIrIx-g
Description: There is no doubt there is a rape culture in the UK, and it is allowed to flourish because of the word "racist". 

Correction: at 14:59 I meant that 38% of cases the ethnicity was unknown, not the other way around. Apologies for the error.

Additional Correction: The graphic of the Muslim population in the UK is also strikingly similar to the one of overall population as well - something I was unaware of and should have looked up. Information is here, thanks to commentators for pointing that out. http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/eandwmap2small_tcm77-272502.png

Addition: In response to my "prove it" request, a commentator provided the information about police reporting procedures: http://m.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11611272.Police_admit___more_to_be_done__to_recording_crime_better/

Addition: the guy was completely right about Marital Rape not being a crime until 1991. The late 1970s saw the enactment of Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, which provided the first statutory definition of rape (prior to this rape was an offense at common law). The Criminal Law Revision Committee in their 1984 Report on Sexual Offences rejected the idea that the offense of rape should be extended to marital relations. Marital immunity was not abolished until the case of R v R in 1991 and prior to that the immunity had been used to escape rape convictions, such as in the case of R v Miller.

Description: Words? Well, words mean whatever you want, if you're a progressive. You'll eventually claim that consumer revolts against corruption and mistreatment are "terroristic" in nature.

Date: 2014-11-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4t58FpsPuL4
Description: Arthur Chu seems incapable of grasping that when tweets at or involving Zoe Quinn are less than 1% of all #GamerGate tweets, she's not actually important.

Error correction: Zoe Quinn's twitter account is "TheQuinnspiracy" and not "Quinnspiracy", but luckily I was lazy and hadn't factored this into my calculation about the gross number of tweets talking about Quinn. It's still less than 1% of all #GamerGate tweets.

Title: The Full #GamerGate BBC Interview
Date: 2014-10-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PNrCieKUq4s
Description: Remastered audio version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajLVUGuYzRE

I feel obliged to publish a recording I made of my full BBC interview. The interview I gave about #GamerGate was 15 minutes long and less than 1 minute of it was featured in the BBC's podcast, but I do understand that production costs money and the BBC did do an admirable job of summarising my position. 

It seems like a matter of public knowledge to have the full interview available, and I apologise for the sound levels of this recording. 

The only edits I have made are to remove the beginning and end of the audio, where we checked sound levels, discussed me personally and what I had for breakfast. This audio is otherwise completely unedited.

I would like to thank the BBC for taking the time to have me on and Dave Lee himself was very fair and professional during the conversation. My only contention is the sparse amount of time allotted to the #GamerGate and #NotYourShield position in editing.

Description: The Fine Young Capitalists (TFYC) is a self-described radical feminist[1] group set up to organize production initiatives for underrepresented labor in the media industry. The group became associated with the Gamergate controversy when their prior argument with indie game developer Zoe Quinn over the group's women-only game jam was recognized by her detractors. Subsequently, The Fine Young Capitalists began to work with users of the message board 4chan, who provided significant financial backing to the project.

This Week in Stupid brought to you entirely by the social justice gaming press.

I literally cannot believe what the social justice game press puts out. I really don't know who they think they are, but it really does highlight everything wrong with social justice culture. 

Addendum: I think I said that Phil Fish had an affair with Quinn, my mistake, I thought I was talking about Grayson at the time.

Required Reading: The Quinnspiracy videos

Title: Let's Play: Depression Quest #GamerGate #NotYourShield
Date: 2014-08-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qlpZ3zie9iQ
Description: Depression Quest is currently free on Steam, so I thought I'd check it out. 

It's a good digital choose-your-own-adventure book, about the life of a millennial Tumblrite suffering from depression. It's easy to read with a very minimalist interface that helps draw focus to the story. 

I found it surprisingly engaging to play. I've never had depression, and I didn't expect to get much out of this, especially given the scandal, but I was drawn into it because I wanted to understand how the main character of the story thought.

It did give me a good idea of the world view of the people in this position, even if I don't entirely understand it. I recommend it for the life experience if nothing else, and it is adequately-written and I did get drawn into it.

Sorry about the hayfever during the video, too.

Zoe Quinn, if you or a supporter reads this but doesn't watch the video: you don't need to flag this. I like your game, and I think I am representing it fairly. Either way, I am using this under fair use for criticism, so think before you fly off the handle.
