UPDATE. In this case I appealed the 'not advertiser friendly' and it was won in about 24 hours. Interesting this happened with the last WDPLAC video. Odd thing there was, a few days later it was listed as 'not advertiser friendly'. I appealed it AGAIN, but this time lost. Sigh......

Description: .... pretty much what it says on the can!

While at the eclipse a creationist turned up and started preaching at everyone. Pretty obnoxious behaviour to be certain. I eventually started arguing with him, and some of that was picked up by some of the cameras I had rolling. Some of it is VERY entertaining. Sadly I didnt get the end bit after the eclipse where I really laid into him.... but theres still a lotta lulz in the found footage :-)

Date: 2017-10-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=j4KR4-TN-Yo
Description: Elon Musk has a GREAT idea.... why not use a space craft designed for going to mars for transporting people around Earth!

Actually, its a profoundly stupid idea on almost every level. Firstly even the best rockets have a lousy track record compared to planes. If only one rocket in a hundred blows up its considered VERY good. Meanwhile if one plane in a million crashes, its considered a poor safety record. 

Secondly rockets are mind blowingly expensive. You can get an estimate of a ticket on a rocket like this as somewhere between 100 000- 500 000 USD. Its difficult to see that ever being competitive with plane flight which will cost ~1000 USD. Elon Musk however doesnt seem to have a problem saying it will only cost about the same as a plane ticket.

Title: 200mph Hyperloop.... BUSTED!
Date: 2017-09-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vwLnyzyybYs
Description: Its often depressing to read 'science' news coverage of things like the hyperloop. If you did you would get an almost universal impression that a pod going 200mph in the hyperloop was a great advance, and had made the reality of the hyperloop MUCH closer.
In reality of course, its no such thing. It was a VERY small electric car designed for a speed run, that would have gone almost exactly the same speed with or without the hyperloop tube. It had NOTHING to do with a building a pod. Not really what you would get from the wall to wall press coverage.
In the meanwhile, the two entries that MIGHT be classed as useful to the hyperloop (one running on air skies, and one on magnets) managed to go ~60mph while being pushed, and 30 mph under its own power respectively. Again neither of these gained anything from being in a 'hyperloop'.

In this sense... the hyperloop is looking more and more like solar roadways. Its promises, promises, promises... meanwhile whats delivered is a farce compared to what was promised.

Title: Thunderf00t at the 12 million dollar HYPERLOOP!
Date: 2017-09-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ktO6IvLT2eg
Description: If your gonna shell out 12 million dollars for a tube..... check whether it will RUST first!
The hyperloop is less than a year old, and its rusting everywhere on the outside. On the inside its completely covered with rust.

There arent many ways you can actually screw up a vacuum tube, but not only is the inside of the hyperloop completely rusted up, they also managed to paint over the o-rings in the viewing port.

I actually also had a chat with one of the hyperloop engineers. To be fair he only worked on the pusher, but he had never really thought about the viability of the project as a whole. He was a nice guy and let me have quite a poke around on the pusher and tube. Nonetheless he hadnt even considered the expansion issue. For me when I got the thermal camera inside the tube... I took one look and 'QED' when I saw the temperature differential between the top and bottom of the tube. He just had a blank expression of 'so what?'

What they did get right is the thickness of the tube. The walls are about 2-3cm thick (~1inch). It would make a convincing gun barrel, and feels like it would contain anything that went wrong in the tube. The exception in the end of the tube. There Im not so sure.

Description: Yes a 'go to dr dino dot com' creationist did turn up and start preaching at people during the eclipse. 

Other than that, I chose the site about Casper WY about 3 weeks ago just to see if you could see the moons shadow moving.

Eclipses are a difficult subject to record. There is a huge range of contrasts meaning leaving the camera on auto expose is going to go wrong. Similarly you have to turn auto focus off. I did that with mine, but nudged the focus during totality.... which is why its out of focus :-(

In the end, I had one fixed wide angle running,
One whole sky timelapse
one distant angle timelapse
one videoing the sun in the H-alpha
and a handheld camera to point at stuff...

Oh and of course a pair of binoculars...... to watch the interesting stuff! -A busy 2 minutes! :-D

Title: 1000 miles driving for the best Eclipse 2017 observing site!
Date: 2017-07-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oiSCEVGVGq0
Description: Honestly to me Casper looks pretty good. The dinosaur museum there (the Tate museum) is small, but pretty fun!

Anywhere across the plains to Riverton is also great. Pine mountain also looked pretty good, but the access roads are hard unless you are familiar with the terrain. Its also incredibly remote. Too remote for my tastes as one guy with a rental vehicle!

The Tetons has a lot of potential, but honestly its going to be CRAZY busy. Its busy enough today, and thats a nothing special day. They are expecting 100 000 plus extra visitors for the eclipse. Even though Signal Mountain and Black Tail butte offer excellent sites for watching the moons shadow cross some spectacular places, it looks like it will be nightmarishly busy. Also... weather might be more flakey in the Tetons. They tend to have clear mornings, and cloudy afternoons. Early clouds would spell doom for eclipse watcher! :-( That being said, there is always risk with watching an eclipse.... one stray cloud is all it takes!

Gonna check out Idaho and Oregon next, but I think Im pretty much settled on Casper.

Its actually been a pretty brutal few days. These places are hundreds of miles apart.... plus having to do all this just after getting off the plane... ouch!

Title: The Hyperloop -I WANT to believe

Description: Whenever I do a video on the hyperloop, I get the wailing of a thousand nerds who just dont want to accept that the whole idea is bullshit. Thats even after its been explained to them that Elon Musk did not invent the hyperloop, but the idea is over 100 years old.

... its also amazing how the same pointless criticisms come up again and again. Most notably 'its only a reduced pressure'. No, if you were exposed to the 'reduced pressure' of the hyperloop, and that of space, you wouldnt be able to tell the difference... because the hyperloop is 99.9% of a total vacuum!

Title: Hyperloop, HyperSPEED, HYPERMADNESS!
Date: 2017-07-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wQXqeWKY2Fc
Description: The first model hyperloop (vacuum train) was built about the same time as the first powered flight. However there is a very good reason why the hyperloop as never been built.....

The problems with building a 600 mile/km long tube havent changed that much in the last 100 years!!! Its just really REALLY difficult and expensive to do. This is why no one yet has built a sensible test track, let alone moved on to practical problems like how do you get capsules in and out of the hyperloop!

I wont be adding this to the patreon supported stream, however if you want to support this channel directly:
https://www.patreon.com/Thunderf00t


one slight correction....calculating the energy of the capsule. The velocity should be ~300, not 1000m/s. This makes about an order of magnitude difference in the energy of the capsule. It would have about the same energy as 200kg of TNT, not 2 tons. Not that it affects the conclusions in any way, but its still a mistake.

Title: Does your life REALLY depend on just 3 grams of oxygen?
Date: 2017-07-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yFFT_ADH1XI
Description: Just randomly started thinking about this this morning.... how much oxygen is there in the entire human body.... as O2?

Turns out, NOT MUCH!
You have about 5L of blood. This is about 30 % by weight of hemoglobin. A hemoglobin monomer weights about 16000 and binds a single oxygen weighing 32. This means 1L of blood contains about 300g hemoglobin, binding about 0.6g of oxygen!
In your entire blood supply there is probably no more than 3.5g of oxygen. Thats a fine delicate wire to hang your entire life by!.... remember... the trick is to keep breathing!

Title: The '5kg in 50 days' Diet!
Date: 2017-07-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mTABw0EyIWY
Description: Theres a simple mass balance to losing weight. You have to expend more energy than you consume. If you do that, you will lose weight.

After that your options become:
1) more exercise 
2) consume less.

Some back of the envelope calculations show that you have to do quite a lot of exercise to burn off 30 % extra calories (while eating the same amount). Great for keeping you fit of course, but a hard way to lose weight. Eating less is less time consuming but of course means you have to deal with the hunger. After the first week however your body adapts to the new norm and things get a lot easier.

I thought I would share my experiences here. Yes its hard, but in many ways its like climbing a mountain. Once you've done it, you feel so much better, and have a great sense of achievement!

I had some inquiries about the data logger I used here. Im not paid by these folks in any way.

Quick summary is pricey, but gets the job done!

The device is called a 'labquest2'
https://www.vernier.com/products/interfaces/labq2/
its kinda a stand alone version of the pi but but is a lot more user friendly. It will datalog up to 4 detectors at the time.

it can also be used with a good range of detectors (which was the main selling point for me)
https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/

They are all pricey, but the functionality is pretty good. I looked at a whole range of gas detectors before settling on this one. Most were related to flue gas or exhaust testing. Most dont 'measure' everything, they will detect oxygen, and calculated CO2 from the O2 drop.
For me I wanted direct measures of CO2 and O2, so the vernier worked out okay. The response time on the CO2 detector is lousy (minutes). Accurate calibration was also not straight forward. It just assumes background is 400ppm for air. If however its not (bear in mind the meter takes 15 mins to equilibrate), thats essentially the % error on the other measurements.
I found the best way for accurate measurements was simply to create your own CO2 standards and do your own calibration.
The O2 meter is fast responding, but requires its own care (needs to be kept upright).
I had some dealings with their customer support about the functionality of their detectors. They responded quickly and in detail.
I wanted to know if I could use their ethanol meter to measure my blood alcohol by exhaled breath. They gave me the honest answer which was 'kinda' but they were fuzzy on the details about the response of the meter to different humidities and temperatures. That still shows they are aware of the limits of their machines and are not simply BS 'ours is the best' salesmen.

Description: Amazingly, Fontus, the 'self-filling water bottle' just wants to keep going.

Initially I demonstrated that what they were promising simply wasnt possible.... thermodynamically. Now they seem to have taken that on board, increased the solar panel size by 10, and reduced the promised water collection by 10.

Their promises are now realistic, but are now basically exactly those of a cheap pelitier dehumidifier. 
Read about it in their update:
http://www.fontus.at/fontus-update.pdf
Off the mains it can under IDEAL hot and humid conditions, maybe get a couple of liters per day. Running off a 100 watt solar panel they can maybe get 1 liter of water per day. Thats 1/3rd of your daily requirement. Ontop of that water from the air tends to pick up all sorts of nasty volatile organic crap from the air, and the trap just tends to be a place to cultivate bacteria.

Description: Its often the way in science, that what you find isnt really what you were looking for. In this case I was just doing some experiments based on a question someone emailed me. 'Do your feet warm up like your hands'.

While experimenting around with that it was actually VERY easy to spot which wrist I broke about 10 years ago when I came off my bicycle.

Sorry its a day late for Towel Day :-)

I took a lot of grief when I first put up the solar roadways video, how I just wasnt being open minded enough. Well now the numbers are in on their first installation, and guess what... its pathetic.
On a good day it generates about 1kw hr of electricity. Thats about 10cents worth. On a bad day its about 1/3rd of that.

Now in my original busted video, I hit on 3 key points. 
1) flat solar is dumb
2) led cant be seen and will use too much power
3) glass is a fundamentally unsuitable material for building roads from.
Dave from EEVblogs came to similar conclusions.
https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog

Each one of those on its own is fatal to this project. So far its clear I was right on 1 and 2. 3 hasnt even been put to the test yet! but when it is, you can rest assured they will find, GLASS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY UNSUITABLE MATERIAL FOR BUILDING ROADS FROM!... grrrr

So many people suggesting a conspiracy is afoot. Im not so sure you need one though. The mains stream media has been becoming more and more click-baitey over the last few years. Honestly the stories from the Daily Mail are run of the mill click bait. Its pretty hard to see this as some great attack on youtube.

Similarly so with the Wall Street Journal. Their pewdiepie stuff was just comically bad reporting, and the same with their youtube ads piece. But is that a conspiracy or just some guy who works out that provoking youtubers is a great way to get clicks?

The thing that makes even less sense is the stampede of companies who withdrew almost a billion dollars in advertising from youtube.

Youtubes response has also been wierd!

Honestly I've been left very baffled by all of this. It seems like a cascade of people with ill-informed, knee-jerk responses all doing stupid things at the same time. Coherent patterns are very hard to find here.

A little more on the details:
to cool down 1 liter of water by 1 degree takes ~4kJ
to boil 1 liter takes ~ 2000kJ
It takes ~ 500x as much energy to heat water up by 1 degree as boil it. Same is true in reverse!
So it took my self cooling water bottle ~ 0.5hrs to cool down by ~ 1 degree, meaning it would take 500 times that long to condense a similar amount of water. 250 hrs.... or about 10 days!... for half a liter of water... or 2 weeks for 1 liter. That assumes FULL sunlight, 24hrs a day and 100% humidity.
1 liter in 2 weeks!
daily water requirements for and adult are ~3 liters per day.

Why everyone turned on Milo did seem like they had all been looking for a reason to distance themselves from him for a while. Took Breitbart only a couple of days of considering whether to fire him before he quit.

The press conference was weird though. People who insist they've been quote mined dont usually apologise, then quit.

A lot of it, as the fox reporter here mentions, is just factually wrong, made up bullshit.

Some of this stuff it harmless enough. 

But the man is obsessed with crowd sizes, and claiming he has the biggest, even when his OWN PICTURES show this is not the case.

My personal guess is that those who deal with national security on a professional basis have worked out that Trump is just not up to the job and an utter liability. Few have an interest in trying to defend the indefensible. 

It genuinely painful going through Trump videos because of the sheer density with which he spouts out bullshit.

Description: So they are going to make roads out of plastic.... they will last 3 times longer.... will handle cables and water... AND be made out of recycled material!! Kinda like solar roadways, just without the solar panels!.. and now it has some 60 million hits on facebook!

https://www.facebook.com/GIGadgets.Fans/videos/1297009613711658/

Their FAQ page is far more realistic where they basically say they dont even know if its possible or not. Makes you wonder why they described it as 'a revolution in road construction'!
https://www.plasticroad.eu/en/

So the IMPLICATION is they are going to use polyethylene terephthalate, which is a great polymer. It's used to make soda bottles. However its just WAY too soft to make a road out of.

Could they make a composite material? Well maybe. Naturally it will cost more. If its fiber reinforced, you sensibly lose the ability the recycle the material. If its going to use rock to make a composite, then its basically indistinguishable from regular blacktop, with the exception it uses polymeric crap as the binder rather than bitumen. Hardly a revolution. People have been adding all sorts of extras to roadsurfaces for years. Most notably ground up waste tires worked quite well. Shoulda put that in the video really.....

Anyways, then you go and read their FAQ, and you realize that this is more things that they hope will be true, rather than the things they claim ARE true in their video, like 'this will be a revolution in road construction'. That BS has now been seen by over 60 million people! -great!

Now it might seem like a lot, but bear in mind this is not really something you can sell. The market for 41K in the entire world is almost nothing. Indeed the only thing that gives it value is it costs so much to make it.

Thankfully, this stuff did good work! We got some of the best measurements on the hydration of potassium in the world!! Indeed they were good enough to highlight some of the previous knowledge about 41K, to the point where I had to bring this sample out of retirement and send it back to the reactor to check the properties of the nucleus.

Title: Feminist Karma DESTROYS SJW Professor!!
Date: 2017-01-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Arcuh-FsPVE
Description: Professor Philip Moriarty (as he reminds us constantly) is a professor of physics! He's also.... and this is the bit thats hard to believe, a hardcore social justice warrior.

Me and the Professor go way back to when he was defending the feminists lynching the Nobel Prize winner Tim Hunt. Turns out it was all based on feminist lies.
In that conversation I tried to get the Professor to understand that men and women are different parts of a sexually dimorphic species. I tried to explain this in simple examples he might be able to grasp, like the fact that no woman has ever run less than 10 seconds in the 100m, and that this was not because women didnt want to run faster, or because theyd been conditioned to run slower than men, but they simply couldnt run that fast.
He would at times simply agree to simple demonstrations that we are a sexually dimorphic species, then ask me what the evidence was for that which he had just accepted.

So some time later he started emailing me for a debate. I told him I was just crazy busy (I was.... 5 international trips in 6 months, as well as producing videos.....thats almost impossibly busy).
Phil just ignored all that and kept writing me jerky emails.... so I did what I would do to anyone who'd been given more than a fair chance, I trolled him. It was remarkably easy to do too!

Indeed, even when I just took pity on him, cos it was clear he wasnt getting it, he still went around calling this 'a debate'.

Anyways, I let him have his fun, cos at the time, I had bigger fish to fry. 

I was however surprised when in the new year I thought Id see what he'd been up too, and found he had deleted everything.

The last video I could find of his, merely days before he deleted his account, in that vid he said his new years resolution was to spend less time online.
There were also rumours abound that his family had been threatened following the Bearing doxxing. 

IF true, thats royally jerky. That being said, he may just have been looking for an excuse to get out, and for it to not look bad.

Further, it would be ironic if true, because he was the one who advocated so hard to strip anonymity from others. I wonder how he feels about that now?!

Title: Bees in Winter, Hot head, Cold bottoms!
Date: 2017-01-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NASrBaIMpWs
Description: So fascinated by how hot the bees were in winter, I went back and took a closer look!

Turns out their thorax is a hot summer temperature of ~30C, their head is about 25 C, and their abdomen is a relatively chilly 15 C. This was all while it was ~0C outside!

I'd heard that bees huddle together for warmth in winter, but didnt really have an idea of what it would look like. The nearest I had was an anecdote my dad told me about how a beehive he had froze to death in winter even though there was plenty of honey in the hive. Seemed the bees were not willing to leave the ball of bees with the queen to go and get some honey.....!!

Description: Last time I asked you to upvote a video, just to see what the effect would be.

Early on it was very dramatic with the video increasing the subscription rate by almost 5 fold.
The views in the first hour were also very high.

After the first day however the effects were far less pronounced. The video had a higher number of views than I would have expected, but nothing like a 5x increase in views that there were on the last video for the first hour or so.


This time I want to see if there if having a massive splurge of upvotes in the middle of the video does anything ;-)

n yeah, Anita Sarkeesian was indeed on the trending list with a video that had picked up about 12000 hits in 10 hours.

Firstly they changed the algorithm. Now you may thing 'so what... their website... they can do what they want'. Then you realize that thousands of people have put thousands of hours of work into their channels, and at a single change to the algorithm their channels traffic can halve or worse!

Likewise, all this year people of been saying that they're being unsubscribed for no reason. Well youtube finally responded!

okay.... so lets take a look at this....
1) half the price
2) the seller has been reselling scientific stuff for ~10yrs. 100% rating on ebay.
3) the seller said the last time it was used it worked.
4) it was being sold on from a satellite manufacturer.
5) camera manufacturer confirmed service history of camera.
6) could not show camera working. Thats not that surprising. Upper end high speed cameras are not really point and push.

Title: Spinning Solar -BUSTED!

Description: Someone sent me this after it went viral on facebook. It currently has over 7mn hits there!
https://www.facebook.com/DavidAvocadoWolfe/videos/10153685785536512/

Whoever came up with idea of putting solar panels on a cone was an idiot. In fact on further looking it seems the company that came out with this idea vanished years ago.... and someone has only just rediscovered their 'brilliant' idea.

Sure its true you generate more or less constant power throughout the day, but that power is about 1/3rd of what a tracking solar panel would get, and less even than a static solar panel would generate.

They then say spinning them will keep them cool. Not really that big of a deal. Solar panels are fantastic in they contain NO MOVING PARTS!. That makes them very low maintenance. If you start having to spin those with motors, you now have to have a more expensive construction involving moving parts.

Lastly they suggest putting it all inside a glass cone... a greenhouse. -just the thing to do if you want to keep your solar panels cool!

Title: EM Drive BUSTED!
Date: 2016-11-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jCAqDA8IfR4
Description: The hype of the EM drive has been truly remarkable.

The creator claims they it will give us flying cars, cheap access to space, and solve global warming.

The come the ground breaking news its passed peer review!!!

Then you look at the details.

Turns out the peer review paper claims the thrust is something like 100 millionths of a Newton per 100 watts.

If that doesnt send alarm bells ringing immediately, it should. To keep a human alive in regular life takes about 100 watts. Just standing up requires a force of 1000 Newtons. Turns out just my breath alone can provide about 100 times the thrust of the EM drive. Indeed the value is so pathetically small, it could easily be an experimental error. Now it turns out the people doing the measurement were at used NASA kit (they had the very sensitive force balance needed). 

Then comes the next problem. The device... IF the results are real, would rewrite FUNDAMENTAL laws of the universe, like conservation of momentum.

So basically, IF a measurement right on the limit of what can be measured is correct, and shows an idea from a crank.... who thinks a non-sensical drive will give cheap access to space (impossible even if it worked as claimed).... was actually right!

The mere fact that NASA wants nothing to do with publicising this should tell you how much faith they have that this is actually an epoch making discovery.... and not say for instance just an experimental error on a 'thrust' that can barely be measured.

Title: The infrared explained!
Date: 2016-11-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uXeM6jRk6w8
Description: Ball park numbers, people are about 2 meters tall.

Dimes, 5 pence pieces, or eurocents are all about 1 millimeter thick. The ratio of 1m to 1 mm is 1000.
If you drop a further factor of 1000 down on mms you get to microns (one millionth of a meter).
The entire visible spectrum have wavlengths of about 0.4 to 0.8 microns.
Turns out thermal cameras are essentially black and white cameras. They just measure intensity. However thanks to a neat trick, you can actually estimate the temperature of an object by how much infrared radiation its giving off.

The infrared region in which thermal cameras see is about 1 to 14 microns. In actuality, thermal cameras break this up into the near, mid and far IR. So my camera see in the 7-14 micron region.

The wall.... will never be completed as stated.....
Obama care has gone from a disaster which he will repeal on his first day, to something he quite likes aspects of.
And hes gone from 'appointing a special prosecutor' against Hillary to thanking her for her long years of service to the United States.
and of course... hes going to appoint the best and the brightest..... yknow like Sarah Palin.

Im also not particularly swayed by this is some huge change in the demographics of america.
2012, it was 65mn to Obama, to 60mn to Romney.
2016 was 61 mn to Clinton to 60 mn to Trump.

..... bottom line, of ~200mn voters in US, the entire swing was ~5mn votes.

Well, we will see........

Description: So the waterseer folks wrote a facebook page reply to my video. Cool I hear you say... surely they will show that my thermodynamic/ conservation of energy calculations are wrong, and that the waterseer is actually possible! -well... not quite.

They complain about the tone of the video.... they claim its Berkeley so they must be right... they complain that I showed students in the video... despite the fact that that video comes from their very own wepage. That is they were perfectly happy to use UC Berkeley students to promote their product, then to use them as a human shield when someone points out that they were in fact spouting BS.
https://www.facebook.com/WaterSeer/posts/1730237293968256

Maybe the most damning thing is that UC Berkeley added a disclaimer to their page the day after I put up my video.
http://scet.berkeley.edu/vici-labs-collider-project/
you can check out the waybackmachine to find the version with no disclaimer... or the earlier video I made.

Title: Waterseer -BUSTED!
Date: 2016-10-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LVsqIjAeeXw
Description: So the Waterseer claims that its going to bring free clean drinking water to the desert, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. Up to 37 liters of free water per day, and all they want off you is $77 000! Of which they have already raised over $180 000.

Nothing wrong with the aspirations, problem is the whole thing is complete BS from start to finish.

The device claims its going to condense water out of the air using the cool deeper ground. First problem is that 'cool deeper ground' more reflects average annual temperatures.... which practically means for about half the year the device would not work.

Then you take a look at some typical desert figures and realise that the device would only work if the dew point is at the temperature of the ground a couple of meters down. This maybe happens for a few days a year in desert areas like New Mexico.

Then of course, you just run the numbers on their claim. They claim they can get ~ 40 liters per day. To condense water you need to get rid of ~ 2 000 kJ of energy for each liter.
https://www.thermexcel.com/english/tables/vap_eau.htm

So they have to get rid of 80 000 kJ of energy PER DAY! Thats enough energy to heat up the surrounding soil four tons of soil from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C. At that point the device would stop working.

So it really doesnt matter which way you cut it.... this is utter BS!

Still not sure if this is a scam or not. The indiegogo people certainly have a lot of scammy looking projects on their Vici labs page. Many of these dont seem to exist ANYWHERE ELSE on the web other than on their Vici labs page.

They certainly got University of California Berkeley involved with this. Indeed its utterly cringey to see a 'chief scientist' of an ENGINEERING center promote something that its utterly trivial to show is complete BS thermodynamically.

Even worse they had a competition, with 12000 bucks prize money, for a concept you can trivially show is a non-starter! Some of the designs need to be seen to be believed!
http://scet.berkeley.edu/vici-labs-collider-project/
http://scet.berkeley.edu/waterseer-collider-winners-announced/
UC Berkeley is meant to be one of the top US universities!

Even worse.... even IFFFFF they manage to make this (they cant.... the thermodynamics just dont work).....they would just get sued by someone else who had the same completely no viable idea!

What was delivered was a 'road' that couldnt be driven
DIDNT GENERATE ANY POWER
had LED lights on that just cycled
LED that were not visible even when the STREET LIGHTS WERE STILL ON, let alone in full daylight!
and of course 75% of them died within a week of instillation.

However the internet seems pretty quick on delivering karma these days. Turns out she was also reporting smaller youtubers for dmca violations over fair use in thumbnails.

(Incidentally, this thumbnail mostly bought to you by @TheCartoonLoon.)

Philip Defranco decided to cover this.... and of course Laci Green responded.

However I remember WAYYYYY back... before anyone ever made any money on youtube..... when Philip Defranco was a big name and laci was a nobody.... till he kinda promoted her... cos honestly before that, laci was going nowhere.

Sure she worked hard to get her breasts into the camera shot, but if people wanted to see that sort of thing, it aint hard to find.

Back in the day someone called her on it, and she got all 'legally' on them, threatening to DMCA their video, then to flag it as harassment.

Then years later, SargonofAkkad was DMCAed by Laci Greens 'Braless'.

Now years later... the slow learner is submitting DMCA complaints about her face being used in thumbnails......just the person you want winning your 'science and education award!'

Just do a search for 'Diffraction Grating sheet 500 lines/mm' and you will find the stuff. It comes in the form of slides (which are useful... you just hold them up to your eye) or film. The film is nice, but tends to be a finger print magnet. Nice thing is you can see a wider field with the film though.
I always carry a load of the slides in my wallet (500, 1000, 13500 lines per cm). Never had I shown them to folks at scientific meetings and not had people amazed!

Title: Youtubes new flagging 'Heroes' 98% disapproval!
Date: 2016-09-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=m6o8RPCHXUA
Description: I dunno who game up with the great idea at youtube of 'yknow what we really want, is to be able to give people the ability to mass flag videos on youtube... and call them HEROES!'.... but.... slow clap!

In other news, looks like spacex agree with my analysis of the falcon 9 explosion:
"At this stage of the investigation, preliminary review of the data and debris suggests that a large breach in the cryogenic helium system of the second stage liquid oxygen tank took place. "
http://www.spacex.com/news/2016/09/01/anomaly-updates

Not that it was exactly rocket science... the more worrying thing is why did they have a failure in their helium system at all? That should be one of the simplest and most reliable things on the rocket. Its basically a high pressure coke can and some plumbing. Why... HOW could such a thing fail?

I wont be adding this to the patreon supported feed cos theres no way I could ask people to pay me the money they do on patreon for merely talking to a camera for 10 minutes... and a little editing. All the same.....Im VERY grateful to all those who support this channel!

Description: Stunningly, Anita Sarkeesian continues her moral crusade against anything a man might consider sexy.

Sad thing there is she seems to be laboring under the delusion that what men find sexy is simply some 'cultural norm'. Actually its pretty much biological in origin, and a lot of what men find sexy is about half the reason we're actually stood here today listening to a dumbass woman say the opposite.

I mean god forbid a sexy woman ever appear in a computer game pitched at men!

FYI... been sick as a dog making this.... if my voice sounds funny.

Title: Detailed analysis of Spacex Rocket Explosion
Date: 2016-09-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EhdQPaABFK0
Description: A more detailed analysis of the spacex falcon 9 rocket explosion.

Several interesting details. Firstly the main explosion is actually from the fuel from the second stage and the liquid oxygen from the first stage.

In order to save weight on the rocket the second stage of the falcon 9 uses a common wall for the liquid oxygen and fuel tank (rp1). Any rupture in this tank wall would doom the rocket.

The quiet 'pop' may well be a failure of a helium tank. They are usually used to keep a pressure in the tanks while they are emptying due to the rocket burning the fuel. If one of these had ruptured while the oxygen tank was full, it could have overpressurized the tank causing it to also fail.

Maybe I can make it a little easier for some of these folks....... these are small... but those are far away!

Believe it or not, belief in UFOs is actually real... and really REALLY big on youtube! These folks aint just poe-ing it... they're real!

The mere fact that if this was a UFO at the distance of the Falcon 9, it would only been about 1m in diameter and travelling ~ 4x the speed of sound without a sonic boom doesnt seem to have bothered them.

Nor does the fact that there were several similar 'UFO' buzzing around the launch pad that day seemed to have phased them in their unshakeable belief that.... ALIENS!

Title: Why did the Falcon 9 Explode?
Date: 2016-09-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BPv0VZcvm4Q
Description: Believe it or not, nasa currently cannot put a man into space. After the shuttle was decommissioned, NASA decided it was going to put their human launch capability in the hands of the private sector. In principal not such a bad thing..... in practice.... its highly debatable. 

The explosion of the spaceX falcon 9 rocket on the pad in Aug. 2016 was a hell of a wakeup call. Nasa hasnt had an explosion while fuelling for ~40 years. This was all pretty well sorted out a LONG time ago.

Further how can you actually get an explosion while fuelling unless you have a structural failure of either the oxidant or fuel?
This looks to be a flaw with the actual rocket design... and further a rather expensive flaw.

Turns out the rocket that blew up cost about 60 million dollars per launch. Further the satellite it was carrying cost about 200 million dollars.

Now to be fair, NASA blew up a LOT of rockets before they worked out more or less how to do it right.

All that knowledge is basically locked up in NASA engineers minds. It seems remarkably optimistic to hope that Spacex will be able to do as good a job.

Sure spacex has done some good stuff. Recovery of the first stage looked impressive, but its so ridden with problems, that in practice its doubtful if it will ever be cost effective.

Reusable space vehicles has been a dream for DECADES, however in practice it cost almost as much to maintain as build new ones.

Title: Youtube starting to shut down SJW critics?
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=D5KiS4Y3sm0
Description: In a disturbing development, Youtube removed the 'ad friendly' rating from a recent Philip defranco video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbph5or0NuM

Now it turns out I'd been hit by a rash of these several months ago. I contested most of them, and youtube reinstated the 'ad friendly' rating. Nonetheless it was clear someone was going through and flagging as many of my vids as possible.

That sucks, because its basicly giving carte blanche to anyone who doesnt like what you're saying, that all they have to do is flay you enough, and eventually they will win.

What seems to have followed the recent rash of this sort of thing is a new set of youtube 'guidelines'. Naturally the guidelines as ever are so vaguely written that anything could be either permitted, or excluded. So in practice the guidelines are defined by their enforcement.
Defrancos video was honestly pretty vanilla stuff for youtube. However conspicuously it had a title critical of social justice warriors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbph5or0NuM

Further Im not so sure what youtubes playing at here. One of the reasons youtube was so successful was the liberty it gave its users. Not that that was entirely virtuous, after all, the more people who make videos, the more people watch them on youtube, the more money they make.
However, this development could be a 'tip of the iceberg' thing which shows that youtube is going the way of twitter and facebook in applying their beliefs to what the terms of service mean. 
Well we all saw how that worked out with twitter, when they banned Milo at the behest of Leslie Jones. Meanwhile she had been openly boasting about how she engaged in exactly the sort of 'bullying' she was accusing Milo of.

Title: High Resolution Thermal Camera 'unboxed'
Date: 2016-08-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BZPZfrgbkUQ
Description: FYI polyethylene is just a simple thermal window for the camera, that also keeps the camera dry and out of the way of humidity.

The camera (optris pi640) is actually (on the grand scale of things) a midrange camera. Indeed when FLIR came and showed me their cameras, their top camera cost over $100 000! 

The FLIR cameras were about twice the price of the Optris cameras (spec for spec). They are clearly nice, better produced cameras. However the software to drive them was extortionate. It was almost half the cost of the cameras for the range I was looking at!
The Optris cameras have comparable specs, but the focus is strictly manual (IIRC, the FLIR cameras had autofocus and quick change lenses... you dont get any of that with Optris).

However the bottom line was.
Optris 640*480.... comparable price flir 320*240
frame rates comparable for both
temperature sensitivity comparable for both ~0.05 K
temperature range, both ~-20 to ~1000C
In reality you could get an extra filter for the FLIR, which took it up to ~2000C which would have been useful. Sadly you have to make your compromises :-(

Sadly almost no one in the main stream media assessed this stuff critically from a scientific/ engineering point of view. They just took them at their word when they said they could construct the completely untested large scale hyperloop for 1/10th the cost of a regular high speed rail connection. They took them at their word when they said it would only cost 20 bux, and take on 25 minutes.

In reality the engineering problems are probably insurmountable. It would be like proposing a floating roadway across the Mediterranean or something.

Im currently making a longer video debunking it, but this was just some fun I had this evening simulating the effects of a tube failure on someone in the hyperloop. A tube failure would likely kill everyone in the hyperloop. Getting hit by a 1 bar pressure wave travelling at nearly the speed of sound is fatal. Any who survive would find themselves in a 500km long metal tube in the dark.

Title: ALL Brexit leaders FLEE the sinking ship!

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2g_qk9Trt_E
Description: So, I figure this is my last brexit video (for the foreseeable future).

FYI, the brexit bodycount was so high, it was actually quite hard making this video. Every other day there would be a new fatality.
Most recently (the day before putting this up) Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race for PM, meaning that Therissa May will be the new PM.
Just take that in for a moment, the UK has just had one pro-remain PM step down, only to be replaced by another pro-remain candidate. You would have thought the conservatives would at least have been able to get in a PM who actually voted for Brexit!

Bottom line is I called this from the beginning and got a SHITLOAD of grief for it. First few minutes of my discussion with Sargon, I explained it was all just a very expensive change without a difference. Now all the promises of the brexiters have evaporated. No one is promising more border security, no one is promising more money to the NHS. No one has any idea what will happen next.

Freethinking means you dont always go with the herd!

Description: So brexit won a 17:16 victory. Probably one of the greatest Pyrrhic victories in history!

Oddly however, the PM didnt decide to invoke article 50, that will START the process of withdrawal from the EU. Curiously he decided to wait to get a new PM (which will take ~ 3 months) and then there is 'no hurry'.

Oddly, none of the brexiters thought this a little weird. Why if you intend to respect the result should you wait 3 months.... maybe years, for invoke the process of leaving the EU?
The period of uncertainty will just screw anyone over trying to make long term plans for investing in the UK.

To make things even funnier, the EU has come straight out said the referendum should be respected and the UK should invoke article 50.

It looks to me like everyone is just hoping that if they leave it for a month or two, something will come out of the woodwork to save them, or it will become so clear to the British ppl that this was a profoundly stupid thing to do that they will want another referendum.

In short, Brexiter, its not even begun until someone invokes article 50. Honestly, I think the UK should sleep in the bed its made, so to that end Ive set up a government petition for you.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8BEZC7auWrk
Description: The last 'Reason Rally' in 2012 was arguable a success. Sadly, I think the 'Reason Rally 2016' will only testify to just how dumb it is to try to build an non-religious movement where the lead item on the agenda is 'LGBITZQ' equality.

Its kinda quantifiable too. Ray Comfort was planning to turn up to 'feed the 5000 atheists' at the 2016 Reason Rally. I have doubts if they will even get 5000 ppl to turn up.

Ray Comfort came with a 'gift' in pocket of $25 000. 

About a week before the Reason Rally, a link appeared on their website saying that they needed $100 000 to make the event happen.

Two days before the event they have raised ~20k.

Anita Sarkeesians speaking fee is about 30k.

Really, at this point, after they have been infested with SJWs, is there anything worth salvaging from the wreckage of the atheism and humanism movements?

Im moving onto debunking some more pseudoscience after this, but this video really got to me making it, as I was there when this was a vibrant and exciting movement, and it disgust me to thing that now its been reduced to the level that Banana man can turn up to the 'largest gathering of the non-religious in history' and GIVE AWAY more than the 'Reason Rally' can raise.

Title: Utah declares porn 'Hazardous'
Date: 2016-04-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=lhCK8JlReSA
Description: I hate people trying to micromanage risks in my life.... and the worst of them all are those claiming to be doing it for pious reasons.

Utah recently declared pornography to be hazardous. A moral panic not dissimilar to that of 'games cause violence' of about a decade ago, or Anita Sarkeesians recent crusade about 'video games cause sexism'.
Great video on the rather erratic youtube guidelines!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF2tCY281Rk

I really dont want the government micromanaging risk, or society like this. If nothing else, its bad for the research in that many scientific discoveries require risk.

Its also an interesting suggestion as to why there are so few great women in history compared to men. To become great at anything you need to take risks, and boy are men better at taking risks than women. This is one of the reasons why they make up 90% of the darwin awards, and 90 % of the people in the 'people are awesome' videos.

Title: CrazyRussianHacker, Plagiarist and DMCA abuser! #WTFU

Description: So when I first made a video showing that CrazyRussianHackers idea about using dry ice for an air conditioner was basically suicidal, I really didnt think anything would come of it. Then recently he filed a DMCA takedown of my video. This resulted in a strike against my account and me losing access to certain features.

Now thats a special brand of idiot who makes a video about a suicidal way to chill the air, then files a baseless copyright takedown of the only warning about how dumb that idea is. Especially against a guy like me who has a history of fighting DMCA abuse!

So.... I fought.....then, while thinking about making a reply to his DMCA abuse... guess what I come across, but a virtually identical video to the CrazyRussianHackers, but released about 2 months earlier!

Feminists have thus given Anita Sarkeesian another ~$160 k dollars (meaning her 200k crowdfunder has reached its 80% minimum funding). This would not have been possible if it were not for 3 large donations of a total of ~$65k!

Nonetheless.... I applaud the stupidity of these feminists who are so intent to end sexism that they happily back a project that is openly and unapologetically sexist! GO FEMINISM!

in the meanwhile, Anita Sarkeesian wants another $200 000 in essentially a rerun of her kickstarter project of 2012, which asked for $6000 to make 6 videos in about 6 months. It actually delivered only 2 of those videos in about 3 years (so far) out of $150 000 dollars she raised! In the meanwhile her organization (which according to her tax return still doesnt have employees) has raised almost a million dollars.... and this STILL wasnt enough for her! And even more surprising is that there are still feminists willing to throw money at her despite this track record!

Description: so people intermittently ask me questions about science on TV shows. One in particular was the scene in Breaking Bad about if you can really make thermite from an etch-a-sketch (or a generic version of one). Honestly, this was in the maybe pile for me, because if indeed it was fine aluminium in the etch-a-sketch, then yeah, it would be relatively straightforwards to make thermite from it. It would also be possible to see if you could indeed melt through a lock with it.

So with that I ordered myself an etch-a-sketch...... and went experimenting :-)

Title: CRAZY Feminist tries to get me fired: BACKFIRES SPECTACULARLY
Date: 2015-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=p5TMmxlsLN8
Description: A quick summary.
Laughingwitch engages in letter writing campaign to my employers, local news papers and the police to try to get me fired and my career ruined.

I let it slide.

Laughingwitch claims I've been fired and makes fun of me for losing my job, and that her letter writing campaign was the cause.

I call her out on her BS.

Laughingwitch claims shes proud of what shed done and that there is nothing people can do in return. 

I point out the fallacy of her position, and soon afterwards people demonstrate exactly this weakness. 

I suggest laughingwitch do a sincere apology.

Her apology is little more than a launching pad for a 'fund anything' campaign. In the promo video her husband calls me an 'evil evil man'. They then go onto the local TV news network claiming 'they have apologized' and that I am guilty of cyberterrorism.

AgentofDoubt thinks the fund anything campaign stinks! He finds the local courts have a ruling against the Keller and Burns for exactly the same amount ($25 000). The court ruling is months before my dealings with laughingwitch!

They later make an update saying $25 000 really won't help them any as they are preparing to file for bankruptcy (something they had been planning to do before I got involved with them) and they are at least $100 000 in the hole!

Theres part of me that thinks it would have just been so much cleaner to simply crowd source suing them for defamation. Then they would have maybe made the apology that the community needs to discourage this sort of douchy behaviour in the future. Kinda like a VFX apologizes to the internets mk II.

Agent of doubts excellent video where he drops the bombshell about Laughingwitches company having a ruling against them for 25k

Title: Karma, ONLY A BITCH, if you are one! SJW self inflicted wounds!
Date: 2015-10-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=o81ig9xOKvs
Description: It takes a special brand of idiot to make a video proudly trying to get someone fired...in a public letter writing campaign... MAKING IT CLEAR ITS USING YOUR REAL NAME! then trying to get someones video taken down merely for using that name.

I got the first 'privacy complaint' yesterday. I got the first message back from youtube saying the video was exempt.
'We have reviewed the complaint and have determined that the content is excepted from removal based on our privacy guidelines, which can be found at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_guidelines. The content does not violate our policies and will remain on the site. '

Shortly afterwards I received two more privacy complaints using exactly the same time reference. 

Thus far Laughingwitch has yet to express one iota of remorse for trying to destroy my career, or celebrating when she thought she had. Karma, ONLY A BITCH, if you are one!

Its got a whole Bahar Mustava thing going for it!

If I were laughingwitch right now.... after she openly made a video showing her sending this email calling me a nazi to the local police, news papers, and of course my employer... when that same email with a google search shows who she is and the company she works for.... I would be making a MOST since apology to the internets!

Title: The Thors Hammer experiment! -Potassium vs Ice
Date: 2015-10-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cDlyg_9m7tk
Description: The Thors Hammer experiment!

Getting alkali metals to explode reproducibly is hard.... and dangerous. This is a relatively safe way of getting an explosion out of potassium and ice.

You get a smallish piece of potassium (~0.1-0.3g) and mount it on a needled (or wire) taped to a hammer. It will work better if you cut it in a flat plate geometry and with the fresh cut face pointing downwards. You then hit a block of ice with that hammer. The results are impressive! Naturally, you will need all the safety kit for handling alkali metals.... notably a face shield, body covering and a decent glove.

Title: Feminist arrested for HATESPEECH #KillAllWhiteMen
Date: 2015-10-08

Description: I utterly disapprove of the whole thing.... I really do. 
Nonetheless I cannot help but savour the irony of those who most strongly advocate the oppression of others free speech rights are the first to get stomped on by that same legislation. 

In this case, the UK laws are messed up... but a LOT of UK law is.

Yes, tweeting #KillAllWhiteMen is a pretty offensive thing to do, but in this case its clear hyperbole, little different from a father saying to his kid 'Ill kill you if you do that again'. That said, a lot of the 'hate' that people like Anita Sarkeesian get is clear hyperbole too.

Title: High speed footage of Potassium explosion
Date: 2015-09-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gc-un-wpl8Y
Description: A mixture of footage I've gotten with the new high speed camera. The stuff with NaK reacting under argon is particularly pretty. There is also some explosions of NaK when being dropped on water and some regular potassium tied to a shot glass and dropped into water. The water hammer effect is fantastic. Yeah, this is how depth charges sink ships!

Part of a prelude to a new experiment which is a safe, extremely reliable way of making potassium explode. It so easy to do, and so dramatic that its difficult to believe that this is not going to become a staple demonstration in the class room! :-D

Title: IF men acted like FEMINISTS (OMG SEXUAL OBJECTS!!!!)
Date: 2015-09-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CZoABBMQ6f4
Description: Drives me up the wall how far feminists will bend things to make sure that they are the victim. 

Their first trick is to claim that they are being treated as objects. In reality of course you could view everything as objects (and in object orientated programming.. YOU DO... damn should have put that in there too, how OO is really just a tool of the patriarchy!). 
I mean the second you have said you like someone over another... you can trace that value judgement to a list of factors that were used to make that assessment. Hell I guess they were just assessed like an object.... and after someone has been reduced to the level of objects, violence against that object becomes intrinsically permissible ... right? right feminists? It contributes to a culture where violence against objects is not taken seriously... RIGHT?

Seriously I gave some thought to making up this crazy shit.... but Ive got to admit, that compared to Anita Sarkeesians 'its not sexy that sells, its sexism'....Im but a pale imitation of that level of crazy!.

Title: Creationist illegally selling false hope cancer drug
Date: 2015-09-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tu4X6OJt-EY
Description: Kent Hovind incriminates his son, Eric Hovind in the interstate selling of the drug amygdalin.
http://creationtoday.org/product/b17-package-2/

Interstate selling of amygdalin is illegal at a federal level:
http://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/q/laetrile/commissioner.pdf

Even though selling of amygdalin is legal in about 1/3rd of states, the federal ban on its interstate sale (due to the fact that theres no evidence it actually works) means that you can only sell amygdalin made in your own state, in your own state. Eric Hovinds site will quite happily ship amygdalin to any state in the US.

http://www.cochrane.org/CD005476/GYNAECA_laetrile-treatment-for-cancer
'The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.'

Title: Shooting Self in face... high speed science experiment!
Date: 2015-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=okyzcngHxhI
Description: so I saw some reviews on the sony rx100 mk4 that looked promising. Honestly, I only got it for the high speed features. Its pretty damn good! These were only a few of my first attempts. Its almost an order of magnitude better than the casio exilim cameras I used to use (and destroy) in the sodium/water explosion experiments. Its also a LOT more expensive! This one came in at ~ $1000, almost 5x the cost of the casio cameras. I've really only had the camera a couple of days, so I cant tell you that much about it. Some features look really good, others really annoying. The bottom line is though, the 'point and push' high speed feature produces VERY good video!

I have experiments planned though! this thing is gonna do some sterling work!

Date: 2015-09-08

Description: Anita says that games make people more sexist leading to the interesting question, why after shes played all these games hasnt she become a misogynist. Especially seeing as she made it clear that she thinks that the less you think these games affect you, the more they affect you!

An even more interesting question is why, if Anita really thinks this is true, did she propose a game concept that encourages the player to physically assault men, treating their bodies as nothing more than objects, in order to be rewarded by the game?

Title: China explosion could have OBLITERATED Yankee stadium!
Date: 2015-08-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_hcwMwFbJKc
Description: Ball park numbers:
1 mole of TNT ~ 250g
1mole of TNT exploding gives ~ 7 moles of gas.
1 mole of gas ~ 22.4 liters

so 250 g of TNT detonating gives ~ 150 liters of gas.
However the gas is not at room temperature (~300 k) but 2000K.
Gas expands ~ 7x when heated from 300 K to 2000 K.

So when 250g (1/4kg) of TNT is detonated, it creates a fireball ~ 1000 liters in size, or 1 cubic meter.

The fireball in the video is ~300m in diameter, or 150m radius.
This means the volume of the fireball is ~14 million cubic meters.

This means ~3000 tons of TNT would be required to make this fireball.

If the estimated diamter of the fireball is reduced to 150m, the volume of course goes down by a factor of 8.
This would still mean an estimated 300 tons would be required.

It certainly seems the chinese estimate of 20 tons of TNT seems on the light side!

It would have also been good to have known just how little effort the NHS put into making their decisions on cancer. 
A report recently came out that said the UK lagged behind the rest of Europe on cancer survival, and we very much saw first hand why this was. Not only is this something I want to share, it was also something that I discussed at length with my dad, and he wanted share to share it too.

Title: The stupidity that just won't die! Solar Cycleways and other snake oil!!
Date: 2015-05-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OR574qhPSDY
Description: This stuff really does drive me up the wall!

The sheer scientific illiteracy of the media!

So a week or so ago, we had all these stories about how 'solar cycleways in the Netherlands had generated more energy than expected'.

Turns out it was still only 50 % of what would have been generated if those same solar panels had been put on the roof of a building. But hey 'solar cycleway generates half power of roof installation' really isn't as eyegrabbing a headline as 'solar cycleway generates more energy than expected'. Grrrrr
EEVblog did a pretty comprehensive analysis of this- recommended!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ZSXB3KDF0


Then we had the buzzfeedblue team add another million or so hits to the 'hendo hoverboard', with their aspirations to levitate buildings in earthquakes. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilao8ExArEE
The cost of the motors, and more importantly a power supply that can supply about 2 megaWatts of power during an earthquake is kinda a killer there!
Which brings me onto Cara Santa Maria, who while she has her moments.... telling a scientist that 'yeah, you just did your own calculations' is hardly a persuasive argument!
Thing is with 'aircarbon' is it really is mis-selling stuff. What they really are describing is plastic made from bio-generated methane. They are not talking about 'making it from the air'. Sure is an easy way to milk scientifically illiterate eco-warriors though!
https://www.facebook.com/ScienceCara/posts/866949466663744?comment_id=867054583319899&offset=0&total_comments=14

And yeah Cara, thats the great thing about understand the subject you are covering, you dont have to understand the process if you are dealing with state functions. Thermodynamics is not dependant on the process!

Oh and yeah, as I said in at least one of my solar roadways videos.... arguably a plausible way of doing this is simply by putting a roof over the road with solar panels on... like the cycleway in S. Korea

Also, it turns out in a war where the ability of fighting machines determines who has the stronger side, that depriving those enemy fighting machines of their supplies is a far better way of neutralizing the enemy force than actually trying to fight their war machines!

Title: Killing Cancer with Sugar and Alcohol!
Date: 2015-03-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=iZtEnjF4tis
Description: Tumor ablation is basically killing off all the cancer cells by either freezing, cooking or poisoning. The 'poisoning' is normally done with ethanol (alcohol), although the reckoning is, the cell killing activity here is by dehydration.
Well all you need to dehydrate stuff is something thats good at absorbing water, and preferably very non-toxic to life.

While visiting my parents, I learned about laculose (a laxative sugar), and intrigued by its action, I looked into how it functioned. Turns out its an 'artificial sugar' which the body cannot metabolize. However its also extremely non-toxic.

Could laculose (as a very viscous solution) be used for tumor ablation. My money says yes. The sheer non-toxicity of the substance makes it an ideal candidate. However injected into a tumor, it will very effectively pull out the water from the surrounding material (eg the cancer) killing it. 

My Dad probably has terminal liver cancer at this point. At an earlier stage ablative techniques could have offered a better prognosis, but we are probably past that now.
Cancer typically kills you by obstructing stuff, and so Im currently looking at physical ways of preventing that. From someone who always was squeemish around organs, Ive gone to someone who daily does experiments on pigs liver.

Title: The 'superweapon' that almost won Hitler the war!

Description: World war 2 is fascinating in that its the first war, when time and time again, technological developments that occurred during the war were critical in determining the outcome of the war.

The first one of these was the german magnetic mine. To say that it rattled the british is kind of an understatement. Churchill said that it 'I fear it may encompass our ruin'.

The story of how it was beaten, in part by luck, and in part by skill, is one of the early and frequently untold stories of ww2.

Title: Anita Sarkeesian fan threatens PHYSICAL VIOLENCE on critic
Date: 2015-01-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YEovq3UHfRU
Description: Well according to a recent boingboing article.....
http://boingboing.net/2015/01/14/how-crowdfunding-helps-haters.html

The MERE fact that someone wrote a trolling email to Anita and mentioned my name means that I am a for profit hater.

I guess that means that... using the same feminist logic, that Anita Sarkeesian is directly responsible for the crazy guy threatening to 'f*ck me up if its the last thing he does'. After all he directly cite her as one of the people he thinks I've wronged before going all 'captn STABBY'.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtHQtfwEEaU&t=19m15s
Oh and BTW, if I didnt link to this video, hannibal would bitch that 'you're trying to hide things', and if I do link it he will claim 'you are trying to set your flying monkies on me'. 
What I do isnt actually important, as long as he gets to complain about it.

Its a weird video. He spends the first 1/3rd agreeing with me.

He spends the second 1/3rd telling me I dont understand ethics, by agreeing with me.

The last 1/3rd is some bitter diatribe about all the imagined crimes that I've committed. Including (apparently) wronging Anita Sarkeesian.


Sure I'd actually worked out how to report him to the police. But honestly, that seems SENSIBLE given the threats he was making.

I later found some video where it turns out that on top of being a staunch feminist.....he's also an angry drunk who wanders the frozen tundra of Ohio challenging corn stalks to fight him in single combat with a samurai sword. 

-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
The bottom line is.... CAN YOU IMAGINE... if someone had made threats like this against Anita Sarkeesian?

Title: First World Feminism vs Islam
Date: 2015-01-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TRUd4Jn6p8U
Description: 5 million cartoons of Muhammad exist this week, that didn't exist last week. 
I cannot think of a more fitting way that people should express solidarity for Western ideals such as free speech, over a religious belief that things it operates above the laws of any country.

Its sad though that while many showed solidarity with those massacred in the Charlie Hedbo massacre, that there are still liberals who think that people shouldn't be allowed to offend others.
Of those who show contempt for the 'Je Suis Charlie' protests was Jonathan McIntosh of Feminist Frequency.
Ironically, also in the news this week was Anita Sarkeesian, who is apparently now living in terror from 'Gamer Terrorism'- even though the last place she talked at, the police (both local and federal) determined she, and everyone else was in no real danger.
The ABC report is one of the largest travesties of journalism I've ever seen. Worse in many ways than the UVA 'gang rape' accusations of Rolling Stone.

Title: RAPE ON CAMPUS -Rolling Stone
Date: 2014-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gIygmneQJCA
Description: Justice is blind and carries scales and a sword. Blind to show her lack of prejudice. Scales for weighing the evidence and a sword to mete out justice.

Extrajudicial justice is messed up. A lynching is a lynching no matter who is doing it. Its almost always done on prejudice, rarely bothers with hearing all the facts, and frequently will lynch completely innocent people.

The justice system, may have many failings, but compared to trial by feminist, its a white gowned angel.

I have to admit that making this video made me extraordinarily angry. Going through example after example of where the most egregious accusations had been made, where feminists 'listened and believed' and the proceeded to make a presumption of guilt and lynch by public opinion those accused.

Description: Ive been playing a lot recently with Kelvin droppers. I have gotten them to do some absolutely incredible things... more than once I've been just been left with by jaw hanging loose with saucer eyes shouting at my equipment that what it was doing was not possible.... and that it should start obeying at least some of the laws of physics. There is something going on here that aint been seen before!

I've been thinking about getting a high speed camera... however they are very expensive... and the truth is... for research purposes... the experiment I can do NOW is often worth more than a better experiment I MIGHT be able to do later.

So I decided to try some stuff with honey as a cheap, readily available viscous liquid. The idea was that I might be able to get some visual insight into what was going on.

The result is stunning. Honey in a strong electric field reacts... once it gets going almost as quickly as water!

Title: Tony Hawk and the $10 000 HOVERBOARD!
Date: 2014-11-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MMZ2cyNxPwg
Description: Is it a scam? well kinda. 

For certain when they claim to be the first 'real' hoverboard, this is BS. Others have made 'hoverboards' previously using either magnetic or aerodynamic levitation.

Looks like their hoverboard works on magnets rotating over a conducting, but non-ferromatnetic surface. Its basically the same technology as a maglev train. The only difference is they've kinda hybridized it with quadcopter technology. That I've gotta admit is a clever idea. In practice however its almost worthless as it just cannot supply the power to lift ratio to do anything useful. Further the engines only seem to be able to lift their own weight plus 50 % extra. Thats just impractical for any sensible application.

They then go on to suggest they will levitate houses with this, to save them from earthquakes, floods and rising sea levels. This is just so stupid its amazing that noone in the mainstream press seems to have picked up on how crazy an idea this is.

It takes a degree of 'media studies' degree skill to declare your readership 'dead' as a large section of the gaming media did with #Gamergate. 

In this ritual act of financial suicide a large section of the 'gaming media' sided with a group of feminists. These feminists could charitably be described as professional whiners in that the thing that they primarily do for attention is whine. At worst they could be assessed on the quality of their arguments.

Even more damning, they could be assessed on the financial success of their feminist gaming concepts. Over a year after Anita Sarkeesian pitched her gaming concept..... no one has touched it. Not even feminist indie game developers.

Description: Okay, I had wanted to get a video on gamergate out today... which I gotta say is lookin like a beauty..... but I've been kinda under the weather, and I just couldnt get it done today.

However Anita Sarkeesian has been putting some jaw droppingly callous tweets out, blaming 'toxic male culture' (whatever that is) for school shootings, less than 24 hrs after a school shooting.

Then after this callous act, she blames the backlash on, you guessed it 'toxic male culture'.

In other news, it looks like Stefan Molyneux is going to get his ass sued.
http://www.fdrliberated.com/exclusive-stefan-molyneux-sued-for-misrepresentation-defamation/

Not quite sure on all the details, but to be honest, the case against him for abuse of the DMCA is a slam dunk seeing as he's on the record saying he filed copyright takedown notices on a video that 'had nothing to do with copyright'.

Title: When Veritasium gets it Wrong! - Trial by EXPERIMENT!
Date: 2014-10-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3Ev_k__U3Io
Description: Veritasiums explanation for the deflection of water bugged me.

A week or so of experimenting later, I had a simple, reproducible experiment that demonstrated that their explanation was wrong.

The concept is simple. According to Veritasium, positive ions come out in the water, while negative ones are withheld. This means that in an electrically isolated system, the first water out should be positive, while the reservoir at the top becomes increasingly negatively charged. However ultimately that water must come out too, and when it does, it should be strongly repelled by the charged object. In reality, that doesnt happen, indeed if anything its more strongly attracted, although this is probably due to the last water out moving more slowly. Either way its a pretty clear experiment for showing that the ions do not move back up into the tap as Veritasium suggests.

Stunningly there is actually some quite recent stuff on this in the literature (last 10 yrs or so), although Im not so sure I believe any of it.

Y'see showing something to be wrong is usually just the first stage in science.... you then gotta show you know whats going on by proposing a model that works. 
In the week or two of experimenting I did, I got enough clear results to show everything is wrong! I have no coherent explanation that merely explains the obtained results, let alone one that can be used to predict unknowns.

FYI, the cones at the end are called Taylor cones and are the core of electrospray which got someone a Nobel Prize in chemistry!
Kinda makes it even more weird that its so hard to come up with a fully coherent explanation of why a stream of water is deflected by a charged object.

-Simple things don't always have simple explanations!

Title: Anita Sarkeesians 'MASSACRE' threats, real, or FAKE?

Description: So the number of people who covered her 'massacre threats' is almost embarrassing. BBC, Time, New York Times, and so the list goes on. Sadly, none of them seem to have bothered to check Sarkeesians history on this sort of thing, or check with the police to see if the threat against her was even remotely credible, or if she was just pulling the damsel in distress act for attention.

Description: 10 000 volts.... not so bad!

So, in order to get a nice stable field to show the error in veritasiums video, I got a Van der Graaf generator.

That was all great.... and I got all the video I needed to show that ion movement wasnt necessary (as veritasium claimed).... and then to show I really knew what was going on.... I did one experiment too many.... then another and another.... until it became very clear I really didnt know what was going on. I had a set of experiments that seemed consistent with veritasium, and another set that were not.

Well.... anyways... you can always have fun with a VDG generator! :-)

I had intended the original video to go in the Patreon feed.... and IF i do manage to work out what is actually going on, I will put that in the Patreon feed... but not this video!

Title: Plastic from the Air, Global Warming Solution or SCAM?
Date: 2014-08-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dzq9yPE5Cbo
Description: Always depressing to see the level of scientific illiteracy in the mainstream media and in many cooperation.

So Fox News, CBS, The Weather Channel and USA today all had articles on 'aircarbon' which purports to pull carbon out of the air through a hose.

They generally try to be as vague as possible, but claim they are making carbon out of the air, and that this will be cheaper than regular plastic.

Thats Bullshit on every level.
Firstly if they are making a polymer out of carbon dioxide, you need to put a load of energy into it. More than you would have gotten from burning the oil and creating that carbon dioxide in the first place.
If they are talking about pulling methane out of the air, they are so full of bull it beggars belief. Methane in the air runs at about one part per million. Just pumping enough air to do this would cost more energy than just making a polymer out of oil. 
Thirdly, if they are talking about making this polymer from biogas/ biomethane.. then all their claims about making it out of the air are outrageously misleading!

Some ball park figures.
1kg of oil makes ~ 1kg of plastic.
Methane is about 1 part in a million in air. So to make 1kg of plastic requires 1 million kg of air (1000 tons). Air is about 1kg per cubic meter so to extract 1kg of 'air plastic' from the air would take about 1million cubic meters of air. About the volume of the empire state building!!

Title: Anita Sarkeesian- BUSTED!
Date: 2014-07-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WuRSaLZidWI
Description: I simply wouldnt have believed that she was this dishonest.

The game "Hitman Absolute" has 20 missions. Of which one includes a strip club. Only 2 parts out of 7 in the mission involve dancers. So about 1 % of this game has strippers in. However if you watch the playthroughs, you will find NO ONE actually attacks or kills the strippers. This is because you are penalized for killing innocent people. I did eventually, after about 60 play throughs find someone who killed the guard and strippers, but they just shot them and moved on.

NO ONE viewed the game as Anita Sarkeesian represented it. That is no one got their kicks out of killing the strippers and dragging their bodies around. This does raise the question of where Anita got the footage for this. It seems reasonable that she was directly responsible (in one form or another) for killing the strippers and dragging their bodies around so she could be outraged at what she had just manufactured. (I could find NO footage of where anyone did this... and I went through about 60 playthrus)

This really is like saying there is a problem with crime in Utopia. Then when people point out that there is no crime in Utopia, you go around on a vandalism spree simply so you can go back to your feminist funders and say 'JUST LOOK AT ALL THIS OUTRAGEOUS VANDALISM IN UTOPIA!'

Title: 'Feminism' Vs FACTS (Anita Sarkeesian DESTROYED!)
Date: 2014-07-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=l9Ju-1I1DTU
Description: The basic word game feminist play to tell you everything is sexist, is they say everything is objects or subjects. They then ignore, that by this method, you can class everyone in society as objects, and just claim that they have shown that women are objects.

They then proceed to claim that women are treated like objects (something which is obviously not true) and is therefore sexist.

This is particularly evident in Anita Sarkeesians new video where she actually thinks that if you classify someone as an object, then its permissible for you to physically attack them.

WHAT PLANET ARE THESE MUNCHKINS ON?

She also seems to have a problem with sexy women being used to sell things without realizing that the reason that sexy women are called sexy is primarily because of evolution.

Trying rewire human biology because of your political aspirations is doomed to end in failure. Just look how well 'abstinence only' worked!

Description: Ball park numbers:
to 25 000 sq miles = 90 bn square meters.

At about 4 tiles per m2, thats 240 billion tiles.

At 50 LEDs each, thats 12 trillion LEDS.

These need to be light up ALL the time you want road markings!

300 LEDs takes about 60 Watts.

Cheap electricity is about 0.06 dollars per kW Hr

So to run 300 LEDs for 1 hr coast about half a cent.

To run 12 trillion LEDs for 1hr costs about 150 million dollars!
4 billion dollars per day,
1.4 trillion dollars per year.

They will take more power just to run the LEDs than will be generated by the road!!!
And thats not including the cost of building the infrastructure, or the fact that the LED probably will need to be replaced about every 5 years.

Title: Solar FREAKIN Roadways, are they real?
Date: 2014-05-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=H901KdXgHs4
Description: Solar FREAKIN roadways is a nice idea, but then again is a pogostick that can hop to the moon as a cheap, reusable trans-orbital vehicle.

Is it plausible though. Well it basically proposes the union of 3 or 4 technologies. LED lights, solar panels, and glass roads.

Glass really isn't a feasible material to make roads out of.
1) its too expensive. Just coating the US road system with roads would cost many times the federal budget.
2) Its too soft. Even with a textured surface for traction, it will wear away too quickly. Dirt on roads is basically small rocks, which are generally much harder than glass. Imagine taking a handful of dirt and rubbing it a window. Now imagine doing that with the wheels of a 20 ton tractor/trailer.
3) I have doubts about the physical properties of the glass to take the load and mechanical heat stress required of a road making material.

Solar panels under the road is a bad idea from the start. If they are under the roads, they are hard to maintain. They will have reduced light from parked cars etc. They are fragile. Not really congenial to the conditions you are likely to get on a road. In many ways building a shed over the road, or just having solar panels by the side of the road is a far better idea. However the power transport really isnt practical. One of the most efficient ways to transport electricity around is as high voltage AC. However to build those lines would probably double the cost of any construction. To bury the cables is even more expensive.

LEDs for variable road marking have been partially implemented. They are usually only cost effective in dynamic traffic management systems. For most roads its utterly pointless as the road markings almost never need to be altered. These LED are usually not easy to see (especially in full daylight when the solar panels are meant to be generating power).

However solar powered roadways has generated well over a million dollars for Julie and Scott Brusaw (a therapist and an engineer). 

I'm still on the fence as to if they are just delusional dreamers or (now millionaire) con artists. A lot of this looks like just direct 'what if' daydreaming, but then you get the part of the promotional video where they are shoveling ground up coloured glass into a wheelbarrow, while narrating that they use as many recycled materials as possible in this project. It's very difficult to not see that as a direct lie. They must know full well that they did not use any of that material in the construction of their glass tiles.

Description: Yeah, we are writing a paper on it, which is the prime reason why no one will let me put any of the really good video in here. Scientists can be funny like that.... I personally didnt care that much. We've basically got the best footage of this stuff in the world, and plenty of it.

What started with some shitty high speed cameras on the cistern of my toilet a several years ago has escalated into an international and interdisciplinary collaboration.

The sad irony is I actually told periodictablevideos pretty much exactly why they were wrong, and what they should look for over a year ago, and they basically told me to get lost.

Admittedly at the time I didn't tell them that I'm pretty much an expert on the aqueous properties of alkali metals, having published papers on all but rubidium. 
But thats the thing with science. Good ideas stand on their merits, not on who's proposing them.

Then again, on the very day I put this up, Donald Trump, an even more successful billionaire business man tweeted this:

Sad really that it came in the same week it was found that autism began long before birth.

Date: 2014-03-15

Description: 'Ban Bossy' has to be one of the mostly poorly thought out campaigns ever.

The basic premise is that women lose interest in leadership because they get called bossy when they are children.

However if your ambitions of leadership can be destroyed simply by being called bossy, where you ever leadership material in the first place?

Secondly, for some reason, they think that women are weaker than men as it being called bossy only destroys the ambitions of women????

If I said something like that, you can imagine the flak I would get!

Title: Which will freeze first in LIQUID NITROGEN, Digital or clockwork?
Date: 2014-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-mLASMl8gg0
Description: Science can frequently take you by surprise, even with the really simple questions, like which will survive liquid nitrogen for longer, a digital clock, or a clockwork one?

In each case there are many things that stop the clock from working. The clockwork is of course dependent on moving parts, and if they are stopped from moving, the clock stops. If their properties change enough it will stop working etc. With the digital clock, all sorts of things can stop it from working, the changing voltage of the batteries, the changing properties of the semiconductors, or simply the liquid crystal display freezing.

SPOILERS, it was the batterys that froze first (I tested it afterwards by freezing the batteries). That really surprised me, because the batteries are a lot of the mass of the digital clock, and you would therefore expect them to cool down the slowest, while the other components are lighter and would cool down quicker.

Title: Freezing your hand in LIQUID NITROGEN, how long?
Date: 2014-03-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_tyQvPdHL2o
Description: So how long would it take for you to freeze your hand in liquid nitrogen?

Its probably quite a long time. The principal reason for this is you get lousy thermal contact between yourself and liquid nitrogen. What tends to happen is the liquid nitrogen boils and you get an 'insulating' layer of gas between you and the cold liquid. 
This is the principal reason why you can dip your tongue briefly in liquid nitrogen, but licking a piece of metal at the same temperature will basically be the end of your tongue!

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists? (part 41, Ken Ham, Bill Nye debate)
Date: 2014-02-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aK7i-dtMaWk
Description: Ken Ham said enough in his recent debate with Bill Nye to keep me going for a year!

This was just one of the more hilarious things he said, where he holds up a diagram from a science paper and claims its like the biblical model. Apart from when you look at the details, the diagram goes back in time ~400 million years, thats 394 000 years before Ken Ham thinks the universe was created. Sure the genetic bottle neck was ~10 000, and not the 2 suggested by Ken Ham, and for some bizarre reason the golden jackals were not killed by noahs flood. But oddly enough if you ignore all of the facts that show the scientific version of events is utterly inconsistent with the creationist perspective, then what you are left with 'confirms the bible'.

Just like when you ignore all the evidence that shows the earth is not flat, what remains, by definition is an argument for the earth being flat. Not a very good way to do science!

For those who want to take a look at the actual paper Ken Ham cites:

Description: Its wall to wall crazies in a panic out there!

Original video suggesting that Fukushima is responsible for the high levels of radioactive 'contamination' on the beaches in the Bay Area of California.

Personally I dont believe a word of it. Firstly because there's quite a lot of naturally occurring uranium, thorium and radium in california, secondly because beaches are one of the places where geological reworking can happen (eg filtering by density), thirdly because black magnetic sand on those beaches killed one of my remote controlled FPV planes, and magnetic black sand is well known for containing elements like thorium, and lastly, some folks with a energy sensitive radiation meter have claimed to visit this beach and showed that the actual radiation in this instant was coming from thorium.

Seeing as there is essentially no fission decay products in nature, you can detect incredibly small quantities of them. No fission decay products were found.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Zw33AVqzQxA
Description: Recently it has been widely covered in the media that ~70 members of the US 7th fleet are suing TEPCO (the company responsible for the Fukushima for THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

On paper they claim all sorts of cancer, however I can find no interview of anyone with cancer. Further the lawsuit doesnt say what the claims are for. What I do find is interview after interview of people describing non-quantifiable symptoms that are wholly inconsistent with radiation poisoning.

The thing that bugs me the most here is radiation is being sold as the 'invisible boogey man' that causes all the ills that you cannot otherwise explain. 

Sure radiation can cause some serious problems, but then again so can asbestos. But this does not mean you can blame any unaccounted for maladies on asbestos or radiation!

In Africa when anything goes wrong (crop failures etc), there are those only too happy to blame witches. The only thing different here is the boogey man is radiation.

Firstly he accepts that there are a lot of laws about slavery in the old testiment (Judeo-Christian), but then goes on to say that this Judeo-Christian philosophy is what the US constitution and declaration of independance was built around.

My reply was Why do people laugh at creationist part 40

Now he's gotten up a new video 'thunderf00t is a slavethinker' (or similar)

His video is mostly an exercise in shifting goal posts (eg okay, well you answered my first 'atheists nightmare' question, so lets ignore that and just keeps asking questions), and pretty much follows the lines of previous VFX exchanges. That is after being fully routed on anything that can be tested, he now wants to hide behind unanswerable questions, mainly 'is the universe deterministic' which actually has nothing to do with if there is a god or not. 
That is, even though god has never been shown to be the answer to any previous unanswered questions, he still clings to the hope that the answer to one of the diminishing pool of unanswered questions might be 'god!'

Its a sad fact that the funding of the National Science Foundation is TEN times smaller than just the tax breaks given to religion in the US.

Battles can be won on resources alone, and to be honest, even with the better arguments, being outresourced by a factor of 10 looks like a difficult battle to win.

I've been making videos on youtube for about 7 years now. Over that time I've created about 400 videos which have been rewarded with over 50 million video views.

While that has been supported by donations for a couple of years now (and I am VERY grateful to those donor, who have spanned the globe, and they are the main reason why these videos are now produced with much higher quality equipment), I am now looking to spend more time making videos, and good will will not pay the bills.

However in reality, I want to do far more than just allow me to make videos full time on youtube, I want to grow this and take it on the offence!

Title: Thorium Powered Car, Drive 100 yrs on 8 grams of fuel!

Description: Thorium is an interesting nuclear fuel, but its not magic.

It still has many of the inherent problems of all other nuclear power. The very thing that makes nuclear power attractive (a million times more energy than conventional fuel) also carries inherent problems.

Nuclear power, suitably tapped is very safe, and a very clear source of power. However the idea of using nuclear power to fuel cars is just bloody stupid. To run a car you need about 200 kW, and the idea of putting a nuclear powerplant in a car that could supply this amount of energy is just bloody stupid on almost every level.

Title: Why 'feminism' poisons EVERYTHING

Description: To be honest, if you can take something as difficult to poison as raising money for charity, and poison it in 15 seconds, you can poison EVERYTHING!

You don't have to look long or hard to find the crazies in modern feminism.

Title: Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher Versus Airport Security
Date: 2013-11-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LHu9IEkP1f0
Description: Richards Dawkins tweet about his honey being confiscated by the TSA drew a lot of attention this week.

Now I've been on the internet a while and have come to the conclusion there are people out there who will ALWAYS hate you. Indeed I have my own little dedicated band of haters. No sooner have I said something bland and uncontroversial like 'the sky is blue' than they will come out saying how I dont know what Im talking about as the sky is black at night.
It seems to me that Richard Dawkins has a similar band of folks who are just looking to put the most unfavorable spin on whatever he says, even if what he says has a very valid point at its core. In this case it was about honey confiscated by the TSA. However Dawkins is not the first to raise an eyebrow at the questionable nature of the TSA and NSA. Indeed if I was looking at trivializing their efforts, I could quite happily spin this as 'wow, the US government spent ~7 billion dollars to ensure that the airplanes were not subjected to the horror of Dawkins honey! Thank God we can all sleep safe in our beds now'.

For those who have an interest, and because people keep asking, the people at the beginning of the video are a v. popular channel called sourcefed (over 1mn subscribers)

Some folks say they were being sarcastic, although if they were, I sure cant detect it, but judge for yourselves!

Title: Religion: worlds best ever scam?
Date: 2013-11-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EsoC10TFCy4
Description: In the second book of the bible, exodus, shortly after 'god' has given the 10 commandments to Moses, god suddenly needs money!

Seriously, shortly after creating the universe and everything in it, 'God' needs money. Apparently he couldnt create it, or take it, so he had to get his main man on one tiny region, on one tiny planet in one tiny solar system, in one tiny galaxy etc etc to give him money. This book has been available for thousands of years, and yet people fail to see the obvious that THAT MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!

The amazing machines that took man to the moon.

Title: 'Feminist logic' Stay Safe = YOU DESERVE RAPE!
Date: 2013-10-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ACGV-fhZ-xs
Description: I recently put up a video which suggested that rape, as with any other risk in life, can be modulated in part by the potential victim. To many this would be a bit of a no-brainer, in that who could possible say 'taking self defense classes has no effect whatsoever on your chances of being raped.' 
I had figured this would be an uncontroversial and sensible appraisal of the situations. However I reckoned without 'feminist' reasoning. Here, merely suggesting that women can through their choices, modulate their chances of being raped, means that I am a 'rape apologist'!

Here is PZ blog on the subject.
http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/10/02/bringing-back-bad-memories/


and Taslima 
http://freethoughtblogs.com/taslima/2013/10/03/video-and-tweets-of-a-rapeapologist-misogynist-atheist/

Yup these articles are pretty much what I remember from 'freethoughtblogs' in that they just drip with pointlessly vitriolic invective. 
PZ Myers deliberately instructs people not to watch the actual video, (the exact quote is "Typical blunderthud, then. So don't watch it.") while simultaneously telling his readers what to thing "It's horrifyingly ignorant, condescending, and oblivious to his own arrogant attitude." -Like I say its amazingly pointlessly hostile invective. Personally Im stunned anyone turns up to watch him spit poison at people he doesnt like. Do they really think this OTT name calling is a 'game winner'?

Taslima apparently can't tell the difference between me and a muslim extremist "I felt I was listening to a Muslim fanatic, not an atheist or a humanist. "

The sad thing, is do they really think they are going to change minds by just spitting poison at people? They apparently ranted over 'some grey bloke' who wrote some blog which started out with "Yes, I'm biased. There are not harsh enough words in the English language to sum up what I think of Phil Mason."

Hmmm, saying within the first 2 paragraphs that you 'hate someone'. Hardly the place to go for a fair and objective appraisal.

The bizarre thing is these folks dont seem to have realized that if you have a 'winning argument', you dont need to say how biased, or how much you hate things, the arguments alone will stand on their merits. Like this video.

Title: TEACH THEM NOT TO RAPE!
Date: 2013-09-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1T0GcHM0s4o
Description: Many people, when confronted with the fact that -their choice of behavior modulates their chances of being raped- take the very simplistic, and unhelpful line that 'its solely the criminals fault'. While in the eyes of the law this is true, it glosses over the fact that your choice of behavior modulates your chances of becoming a victim. For instance, putting locks on your door reduces your chances of being burgled. Not being alone reduces your chances of being mugged and so on. However frequently when you suggest that peoples actions can reduce their chances of being raped, many people, (notably feminists) view this very differently. They accuse you of supporting rape culture and blaming the victim. Curiously though these people do not suggest that putting locks on your doors is supporting thief culture and blaming the victim.

The bottom line there are almost always things you can do to minimize your chances of ending up in a dangerous situation. Advising women that this is not true simply increases their chances of being raped.

Title: Why 'Feminism' is poisoning Atheism (Part 5)
Date: 2013-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LxNhYY6EvfQ
Description: To contribute to seeing PZ Myers get sued.
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/michael-shermer-legal-fund

Other than that, it was very sad to see Dave Silvermans actions this week. It is however not a new trend. Dave Silverman was almost the first in line to voice his support for Amy Roth after her famous 'being reduced to tears by a tshirt' incident at TAM a year or two back.
http://thunderf00tdotorg.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/feminist-reduced-to-tears-by-t-shirt/

At the time I figured Dave was doing the politically astute thing (and I have little objection to a little such horsetrading), and wrote some very banal piece that really didnt fit under the title of 'speaking out against hate directed against women'.

However since then, again and again, I've heard him sounding more and more like a 'social justice warrior', and less and less like a man whose primary goal is promoting atheism. This has now culminated in the latest American Atheist convention both inviting PZ Myers (the man who has recently published anonymous third hand accounts that Michael Shermer is a serial rapist), and instituting a code of conduct at their convention that prohibits 'harassment based on religion'. The crazy thing being is that if I were to attend the AA conference, I would be expected to display a code of conduct that the institute itself doesnt uphold when it creates its religiously offensive billboards.

Description: This is Jen Mccreight accusing Krauss of all sort of horrible things based on hearsay.

Based on nothing more than 'someone told me' she was happy to report someone as the number one, the worst offender. Go Social Justice Warriors Go!

Then just to show how much she fully backed her statements, she started changing them the very next day, when someone apparently threatened to sue her.

No better way of showing that you are a warrior fighting for social justice, that the second a bit of commitment is required, turning tail and running away.

Title: BBC 'Men are raised to hate women'
Date: 2013-08-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=g0dZIQZIfkg
Description: The BBC recently carried a story about how women are particularly harassed online. This was mostly justified by an interview with a woman who stated that 'men are trained to hate women'.

This is just off the wall batshit crazy. You simply cannot sustain such an opinion and still be on planet Earth, and this was the jumping off point for the rest of the story which was about how some guy has written a 'blockbot' to systematically flag peoples twitter accounts. 

The story contradicts itself on several important facts. Firstly Paul Mason (the reporter here) states he has never been seriously griefed when talking to a troll, even though only 40 seconds earlier in the story he states that he has many abusers on his twitter feed. Not the best evidence for this being a problem specific to women. Secondly he chooses Rebecca Watson (of Skepchick) as his example of women being harassed online. Rebecca Watson, just so we are clear is one of the biggest professional victims around. Indeed if you look at her list of whats shes actually done, making a fuss about being politely asked out for coffee dominates her list of achievements. 

so here is one of the BBC articles impartially titled
'Is there a tech solution for hatred of women?'

Title: Cesium, the most reactive Alkali metal!
Date: 2013-07-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PxUV4cB9Ehw
Description: Is cesium really as reactive as people say it is?

Does it catch fire on contact with air? 

Does it explode on contact with water?

etc. 

Well yes, it is pretty reactive stuff. It reacts with air almost immediately. However if its a lump of cesium, it takes a time to heat up. You get a little film, or drop of cesium in air and it will catch fire pretty quick. And yes, it explodes pretty quick on contact with water. However it really isnt that different in reactivity from sodium potassium alloy, which casts doubt on many of the hand waving arguments about cesium being the most reactive of the alkali metals.

Title: How to Measure the size of Earth!

Description: You have lived your entire life on the rock beneath your feet, but have you ever wondered how big it is?
Well mid summer this year (2013) you have the opportunity to join in an experiment to measure the size of the earth!

The minimum requirements are that you have the ratio of a vertical rods height to its shadow (when its shadow is at its shortest). We will also need your longitude so we can calculate how far north and south we are on this Earth.

However even better would be if you could video the hour or two before and after midday, as then we can put the video of shadow lengths together from all over the world such that people can see the geometry of the earth from a different perspective!

Title: Feminism versus FACTS (Part 3, RE Damsel in distress II).
Date: 2013-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c_O1R7Zq9EI
Description: One of the key features of Anitas most recent 'Tropes vs women' series is that sexist stereotypes in games like Mario are important in determining out attitudes to women in society.
The bottom line is this is bullcrap, and the Mario games have no more impact on the promotion of sexist stereotypes than they do on the promotion of cruelty and demonization of turtles. 

Anita also makes the bold statement that these games promote sexism. Well I've heard many make claims like this about violence and video games. The problem is though, that given the amount of violent video games played, the effect on violence on society must be small to negligible. This is a far FAR stronger case than Anita has for claiming that Mario like games promote sexism.

The account has been retweeted again and again by coughlan616 aka coughlan000. Coughlan has previous form for being involved in setting up accounts impersonating me and photoshopping pictures of me masturbating to them.

This is the thing. These folks can be as spiteful as they want, I just don't care. But you cannot impersonate people with the intent of ruining their reputation.

Description: Yup, the intellectual artillery of atheism plus now thinks Im an amoral sociopath incapable of feeling any human emotion. Odd I thought this was simply lashing out because his talk at the American Atheist convention got shitty ratings. Now you might think thats jumping to conclusions, but virtually every time Carrier mentions his talk, he begs people to upvote it if they support him. Its not really even my doing either, his talk had v. poor ratings before I even mentioned it. Lets be real Atheism Plus is just something that has poisoned its own well by its antisocial behavior.

Richard Carriers blog by the way is an absolute scream. I've not laughed so much at such over the top drama queen antics for years! The whole things is crazy long (~ 8000 words), but I would recommend the conclusions!
http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/3364

Richard Carrier speech at the American Atheists convention:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au2i3xxgv7U&t=10m30s

While I've got a few more videos to make on feminism (cos lets be real, a lot of this feminism is as batshit crazy as any creationism), I dont intend to stick with this long term. However for the meanwhile, its just sickening to see all these PC liberals fritter away the communities reputation of having 'big hitters' at its core to having professional victims and whiners at its core.

Title: Why 'Feminism' is poisoning Atheism (Part 3)
Date: 2013-04-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=95LG9crl3yo
Description: So Richard Carrier got up at the American Atheists Convention 2013 in Austin, TX and gave a speech about how we should all adopt atheism plus.

I really have a problem with someone saying 'I have the best moral values, and you will be disowned by our clique if you dont adhere to them'. Who appointed him sole moral arbiter for atheism?

Secondly, his retelling of the story of how he merely advocated for reasonableness, integrity and compassion and got compared to Hitler is outragously dishonest when one compares it to his original post (one he has since re-edited to amend history).
He talks about disowning people as cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers, and then describes this as merely advocating reasonableness, integrity and compassion.

This is about as honest as watson and co getting all the shit they do for the really stupid shit they say, and portraying the backlash that anyone who says something dumb online gets as SEXISM!

Richard Carriers speech can be found here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au2i3xxgv7U

You can also find his blog where he begs people to undo the work of the 'haters' who are downvoting his video. A curious behavior since in his talk he asks people to downvote stuff they dont approve of as a 'social punishment'.
http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/3351

Carriers original blog on Atheism plus can be found here:

In this video I take to task Feminist Frequencys latest video on 'Tropes vs women: the damsel in distress'

I have two main problems with her video, the first is the way she takes a very, VERY natural response, like wanting to protect your loved ones, as for instance a damsel in distress, and turns this into objectifying the damsel in distress. This is simply bollox. Most people are perfectly capable of wanting to protect a loved one without thinking of them as an object.

Secondly is turning the games industry into some patriarchal conspiracy out to subjugate and objectify women. This is simply delusional, the games industry only cares about turning a profit, which it does by turning out fun games that people like to play. 


I also find it rather weak that she holds up the 'pity shield' and adopts professional victimhood as seen in her ted talk. The conspiracy she paints is pretty paranoid. The reality is, pretty much everyone who wildly expresses an controversial opinion forcefully on the internet gets hatemail. In Anitas case, I think the majority of hatemail she got was simply because she was talking bollox. Thats always kinda a button issue on the internet!

Title: Liquid Metal Explosive! (sodium potassium alloy)
Date: 2013-03-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3M1hfjxMU
Description: If you take sodium (a soft, but solid metal) and potassium (a somewhat softer but still solid metal) and mix them together you get a beautiful liquid. However this liquid really is beauty and the beast in that when it reacts with water it releases about 6kJ per gram of energy. Thats about one and a half times more energy then that released by TNT exploding!

I had always assumed the reaction between the alkali metals to be fairly well understood, however the more I've looked into these reaction, the more complicated and fascinating they become. I mean REALLY fascinating.

You may have also seen a recent video by periodicvideos where they claim this is all very well understood. Thats simply bollox, and you dont have to scratch very deep in the literature to realize this is the case. Indeed you only have to look at the paper they dig out to show how 'well understood' this is. This paper, is closer to a hypothesis on thermal explosions. Difficult to see how thats relevant to a heterogeneous chemical explosion where the reaction generates hydrogen that keeps the reagents separate.

Title: Why sodium explodes (a message to periodicvideos)
Date: 2013-01-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xMfQSV4ygHE
Description: I think I've finally come up with a reasonable explanation as to why alkali metals explode.

In the rare event of a good contact between the metal and the water (usually hydrogen generated on the interface keeps the reagents separate), the electron transfer happens rapidly, leading to this situation:

Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ Na+ 
OH- OH- OH- OH- OH-
H H H H H

Now the sodium and the hydroxide being next to each other isnt a problem as they attract, but having the cations next to the cations, and the negatively charged hydroxides next to each other will create a force moving these ions apart. This will cause new sodium atoms and water molecules to come to the surface. This is the sort of positive feedback mechanism that you need in order to get and explosion.

Now I have to tip my hat here periodicvideos here as it was their new footage that got me thinking about this problem again. Sure I had loads of high speed studies of this, but had ultimately come to the conclusions that whatever was happening was beyond the capability of my camera. However the periodicvideos camera looks to run at ~1000 frames per second, and they are still probably an order of magnitude outside of the regime they need to be looking at. Sodium is also a poor choice as it tends to explode less, and just stably fizz on the surface. Probably the best target for getting the required results is 300mg (1/3g) of potassium in a good quality wine glass filmed from underneath. Potassium almost always explodes in relatively short order, and I never got these sorts of quantities to destroy the glass.

There are also a LOAD of other smaller things that make me grind my teeth in these videos as you really dont have to think long or hard to work out that these are either urban myths or bullshit. Like saying the guy in the middle of the explosion is more likely to survive because the explosion goes out from where he is. If he is in the middle of the explosion, the gas will have permeated his clothes. Any exposed skin will suffer burns from the ~2000 degree fireball. Further the pressure wave will also mess you up pretty badly. Its far more likely that someone sets off the explosion will actually set off a limited burn, that can lead to a explosion elsewhere. Let me put it another way, these is all demonstrated by the example of a hydrogen oxygen explosion. They guy standing a few meters away very sensibly has ear protectors on. Had he been in the middle of that when he set it off it would have messed him up royally! At the simplest level he would be stood in the middle of a 3000 degree fireball!

Title: How to fly on absolutely NOTHING?
Date: 2013-01-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=F74Fb099ESc
Description: So how do you fly on nothing, nothing at all? The answer is kind of tied to the cliffhanger from my last video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgGghuA2r78 ).

Turns out the most buoyant thing you can put in a container is nothing, absolutely nothing. A vacuum! So a vacuum balloon would be more buoyant than either a hydrogen or a helium balloon!

So why haven't we made one yet? Well it turns out that making large light vacuum containers is technically very challenging. It certainly hasn't been possible to date, but its my reckoning that with modern materials, it should be possible to create a vacuum balloon. Further I just think it would be sooooo cool to actually have a balloon that floats on nothing... quite literally nothing!

Title: DO NOT WATCH THIS (if you hate cliffhangers!)
Date: 2013-01-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cgGghuA2r78
Description: So one of the thing that amazed me about the periodic table videos slow motion hydrogen burns was the strange flame patterns (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTgeeTB_kA). Initially its all well behaved as the flame propogates around the hydrogen air boundary, then this great flame shoots through the middle of the hydrogen cloud. Now that for me was fascinating as there shouldnt be any oxygen there. Closer inspection of the nature of the burn suggests that what is going on here is a conservation of momentum type problem. Initially there is zero momentum. Then the balloon is burst and flies off to the left meaning that in order to conserve momentum, the gases must move to the right. This is what provides the tongue of fire.

Now this can be fairly easily tested by looking at a heavy gas, like butane. Ysee in a hydrogen balloon, most of the mass is actually in the balloon, where as with a butane balloon the opposite is true. This leads to some interesting observations.

Description: From sea to shinning sea!
Yup, they quite litereally go from NY state, to the pacific ocean!

So I was actually looking for all my old slow motion footage of hydrogen burns and explosions and came across a LOAD of really quite fun footage that had been left on the cutting room floor.... and so before you can say 'clip show'.

However in this case, virtually all of the clips have never been seen before.

This is all a prelude to a video from periodic table videos where they pose the question, when hydrogen burns in a flame, it does so with an almost colorless flame (see space shuttle engines). However when its burned from a balloon it has a reddish tinge to it... why?

Now I thought that was a very straightforward problem with a very simple answer. However simple answers are not always right.... this is where experiments come in :-)

Title: Do hot girls have all the advantages?

Description: Do good looks actually work for or against you on youtube? Well if it was a straight attention economy, then obviously yes. However much of what goes on here on youtube is about communication, and there a lot of this 'free attention' really does get in the way.
For me its a tricky question. I've long suspected that if I was a pretty young girl, it would be a LOT easier to get peoples attention. However the flip side is not all of that attentions where you want it to be.

Now I've got a lot of respect for Ana Kasparian of The Young Turks, primarily for the stellar example she gives of how to deal with online criticism. This factor should be stressed as Ana is kinda pretty, and as expected, gets a lot attention for it, and not all of it is pretty or where she wants it to be. However her ability to ignore the simplistic chatter and stay on target has to be admired.

If only we had more women like this in the secular community. Yknow the simple stuff, lead from the front, lead by example etc etc.

Thing is its difficult to do that with professional victims always trying to make the whole bloody conference about them. This is a distraction we can do without!

Further having people like the girl in this video (President of some University Secular society (or similar) going around suggesting that rape threats are currently acceptable at conferences is a prime example of why this sort of feminism is poisoning atheism.

Of course if you go around MISINFORMING people that credible rape threats are not considered harassment at such conferences, you are going to put women off attending such conferences.

Finally, I am really interested on you how you think, given a few thousand dollars we could inject some new life into the youtube video producing community.

Description: Yeah, 'Feminism' is in quotes there for good reason. 

Equality is great, but thats not really what this is about. Its about a small bunch of PC whiners who suggest such outrageous things as 'there is an active debate online at the moment as to if women in the secular community should be either eye candy and f*ck toys for the privileged white men, or equal colleagues' (PZ Myers). 

Well they to create this boogie man as a scare tactic to get 'harassment' policies in place.
Now if you had sane, stable and rational people in charge of such things, I wouldn't have a problem, but the thing is the PC whiners who want to be in charge of this basically want policies that echo their fringe feminist beliefs (yknow, things like there being a discussion if women are f*ck toys for privileged white men).

They also seem to want this policy to protect them from criticism. That is you shouldnt have the right to say things that might offend people at a conference, because thats almost as bad as physical assault.

Title: 'School Massacre, A Christmas Reminder from God'
Date: 2012-12-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ILxJvgjzBj4
Description: William Lane Craig has now said that the school massacre in the Newtown school massacre, were actually part of 'God' reminding us about the original slaughter of children by Herod in the bible. Of course, when you look at the Herod story, the thing that really strikes you is just how pointless the whole thing was.

God sends a star to guide the wise men, but its not a very good guide, so they end up going to see Herod. Herod then is told about 'the King of the Jews' and tries to trick the wise men into finding Jesus for him. However ONLY then does god seem to pay any attention and sends a dream (SMS of the bible) to the wise men telling them not to see Herod again. After that Herod goes and kills all the children in Bethlehem. Now firstly if God had told the wise men in a dream in the first place to not go see Herod, no one would have died. Secondly, if 'God' was willing to send a dream for the wise men, why not for the parents of the children about to be killed? And this is Craigs justification for why the school shooting was actually a reminder of how God needed some more friends.

One can't but help think if Craig would have been quite so keen to describe this as a message from god if it had been his children who had been killed.

For my part, I think that banning assault weapons is an obvious, and practically efficient place to start.

So why didnt the ipod need to be burried in the ground for 20 000 years as radioactive waste? Well, turns out how radioactive stuff gets when its hit by neutrons depends on what elements are present. In this case we knew that none of the stuff in the ipod was likely to get very active. This was confirmed by subsequent radiation screening.

Dr Manhattan and the intrinsic field generator, Spiderman being bitten by a radioactive spider, and of course the Incredible Hulk and his gamma ray overdose.

In reality of course places where you can get exposed to such radiation have a LOT of safety features. Take for instance the reactor in this video, its got something like 5 failsafes. 5 rods can be dropped into the reactor, each of which will kill the criticality in milliseconds. They are held up by electromagnets, so if the power fails, they drop under gravity into the reactor. If somehow they don't drop under gravity, they can be pushed by compressed air.

Anyways, this is a little taster of what its like to work inside a nuclear reactor! :-)

The idea is to start a google hangout from the ipod, then.... from a very safe distance lower the ipod into a neutron beam. Even I'm not entirely sure what this will look like, or if the ipod will survive the ordeal. Even if it does, that might not be the end. On site is also one of the most powerful x-ray sources in the world. If it survives the neturons, it may well get a healthy dose of 'white beam' which would probably just cut the ipod in half!

I will also be doing a fairly rough and ready video blog while at the reactor, as there is so much frickin cool stuff there!

Title: The Doomsday Explosive! (The Neutronium Bomb)
Date: 2012-11-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=o_EBqZPCZdw
Description: Neutronium was the material used in the hull of the doomsday machine in Star Trek. 

Now I'm not terribly sure what the mechanical properties of neutronium would be like. It certainly is very dense (about a billion tons per cm3, about the volume of the end of your little finger), but it interacts with matter only weakly. I would expect both it to be pretty inefficient at stopping both electromagnetic radiation (neutrons only have a magnetic moment), and matter.

However in reality there's a somewhat bigger problem. When neutrons are outside of the nucleus of atoms, or are outside the huge pressure that exists in neutron stars, they have a half life of about 10 minutes. To make it even more awkward, when a neutron decays, it releases about a MeV of energy. So put a few extra numbers into this, like a mole of neutrons (6e23 neutrons) weighs about a gram, and a ton of TNT is 4e9 Joules and you can work out that just the neutrons in your typical human (about half your body weight), will release about the same energy as a megaton (one million tons of TNT). A little more scratching around on half life calculations and you can work out that if you have a half life of 10 minutes, then you will release about 1 part in 1000 of its total energy in the very first second.

This means that if you could extra merely a ml of neutronium, and free it from that immense pressure, then it would release the same energy as 15 million Czar bombs (the largest man-made bomb ever) in the very first second.

Title: Some AMAZING Facts about Life, Part 3!

Description: Here we take a look at protein folding. Not a subject that blows a lot of people skirts up I know, but it's actually a great way of showing how calculating the odds of things happening at random really is kind of pointless if THEY DON'T HAPPEN AT RANDOM!
Sure with protein folding, as with evolution, random chance does play a factor. But in both cases, random chance isn't the only thing that determines a trajectory! In the case of protein folding, it's the free energy of the protein configuration, with evolution it's environmental selection.

In this part we take a look in a little more detail at one of those sets of biomolecules, specifically the proteins. How the amino acids are actually really simple mixes of some of the most abundant nuclei in the universe, and how they have even been found in space. How the amino acids stick together to form proteins, and how these can do things, like transport oxygen. Its also briefly touched on how mutations can lead to proteins with somewhat different functions and how this can lead to evolutionary change. In the next part I will finish up with the proteins and get onto the nuclear physics we need to study this system :-D

Description: Life can be pretty amazing, but what exactly is it at its core?
Life at its simplest is basically a series of chemical reactions that can replicate themselves.

Now all life we have yet come across is tied up with water. Waters a really common, and really polar molecule: theres nothing else really like it. Its strong polar interactions make it an excellent solvent for pretty much anything polar, and also a terrible solvent for non-polar molecules like oil. Life is interesting in that its a subtle interplay of things that are soluble, and not soluble in water. This leads to the changes in the structures of biomolecules that in the end play a key role in life.

Description: The last Venus transit till 2117 and who knows what the world will look like when that happens!

This is footage both in the visible and H-alpha wavelength of the Venus transit of 5th June 2012. I watched it from near the power substation for the Keck Observatory, about one vertical mile below the summit (although I was still at an altitude of ~ 10 000 ft, ~ 2miles).

This whole trip was put together at incredibly short notice. Indeed this was my first attempt at solar timelapse and my first attempt to use the H-Alpha telescope to do it. Knowing nothing about such things, it's usually my reckoning that it takes about 3 attempts to get good at this sort of thing. If I had know more about H-alpha telescopes, I would have certainly spent more on one. The solar scope I got cost about 1000 bux (in europe where i was at the time), but if I had really known what I was doing I should have probably spent 2-3x that amount. However even if I had known that, it was not clear I would be able to buy such a telescope in time, and even if I could, when I travelled to Hawaii, virtually ALL of my weight allowance was tied up in equipment (plus a change of underwear). Even at that, I borrowed a tracking mount from a local and very well equipped astronomer friend (MANY thanks Chris) without which this simply wouldnt have been possible. I've got to say that given the constraints that I had (inexperience, lack of proper kit, lack of transport ability lack of time etc etc) I'm actually very happy with the way this turned out. I know of people who had far more (and much better) kit than me there who came away with very disappointing results, mostly due to the dust and wind! I've had a blog mostly finished on this for some time now. Hopefully will get it finished in fairly short order after this.

Oddly enough though, for me one of the most golden moments of the transit required only a piece of baader film and a naked eye. So using the film to safely look at the sun, you could easily see Venus as a black spot on the Sun, and in that moment, it became very easy to perceive (the movement was so slow you could not directly see it) the dynamic movmement of the solar system. The rotation of the Earth as the sun dipped towards the horizon, and Venus orbiting the Sun, as it slowly drifted across the solar face.


I should also add a big thanks T and D for helping out with this trip, and particularly in taking me snorkling (first time in my life... and with good reason, Im a bad swimmer). It was there that we came across the turtles which was a moment that really stuck with me.

Also a big wave to L and A for shitz n giggles in the near equatorial sun! -Wearing a bikini has never been so much fun :-)

Title: FreeThoughtBlogs and PZ Myers
Date: 2012-07-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=96FtpDLi_Vw
Description: Looks like this description is too long, so I will post it on my blog @
http://thunderf00tdotorg.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/freethoughtblogs-and-pc-lyers/

So PZ Myers is the man who gave me his personal assurances that Freethougthblogs really didn't have any interest in controlling the content.
This was evidently a verbal assurance made in bad faith.

The rough time-line is one week before I was banned, PZ sent this to some mailing list Freethoughtblogs has:

'There is no policy requiring that you ignore fellow FtBers. If you see something you don't like, rip into it. That goes for everyone here.

Except me. I'm perfect, don't you dare say otherwise'

Well that's basically what I did, and what's more I even told them on their mailing list.
Then I week later, PZ kicks me. Maybe he wasn't joking about that ' Except me. I'm perfect, don't you dare say otherwise' bit!
This was done without any consulting the other members of the network giving this a very totalitarian 'execution' type feel. Everyone else on the groups was told of my 'expulsion' AFTER it happened, I mean hell, they wouldn't have wanted an actual discussion or to give anyone the possibility to dissent about what is permissible 'freethought' on freethoughtblogs now would they! 
Now I really didn't care about offending these people at this point as on their mailing list I had already been accused of being a 'rape culture apologist' (FFS, I don't think I've even touched on the subject), guilty of ablism, devaluing addicts, an not being careful between challenging islam and outright racism. All of this based on NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER (well that's unless you are happy to count rumors as evidence). 


To be honest, I was hoping that there would be a higher standard of conduct that that, but the chatter made it clear that FTB really was somewhere between a bitching slimepit, and Strawman City. It was also plain to me from just watching the chatter on this mailing list that there was a significant amount of bullying of weaker members/ opposing viewpoint. If this was an academic environment I would have called bullshit on them in an instant, however by this time it was clear the standard of people that I was dealing and that as a group they were essentially a lost cause. I was happy to write a blog there (which on inspection looks like it was pulling in ~10 % of the FTB site traffic (FTB claims to get some 150k views a day, my blog was pulling in some 10-15k hits per day)), but I certainly wasn't going to waste my time ingratiating myself with such people. As an entirely peripheral note, FTB never paid me a penny, (again something that PZ said they would), but to be honest I have no interest in such things. Integrity IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN money.

So I blogged about something which, and I quote, 'I thought they were way off base on',
in the disproportionate amount of time they gave sexism compared to other subjects, and the way they attacked an demonized people who bought up sensible concerns.

I had expected that PZ (an university lecturer) would at least keep his word on the academic integrity thing, but to be honest, after about the 3rd day after posting my first article, it was clear that wasn't worth spit. When a man is willing to jettison the value of his word so readily, I was under no illusions ' If you see something you don't like, rip into it. ' in reality meant that you should only rip into it as long as PZ thought it was okay.

However, I was not going to be bullied into submission by a bunch of second raters, and so despite a series of threats, and Ed Brayton making it clear that if I felt PZ hadn't kept his word I was free to leave 'and not let the door hit your ass on the way out', and that 'no one would miss me'. That's right, the fact that PZ way lying to people faces to get people into the blog really didn't phase anyone at freethoughtblogs at all! Nor did such explicit threats on the mailing list seem to phase anyone else (no one stepped forward to question such action), which I think shows that bullying is just so widespread on FTB that it is the socially accepted norm (that's unless like me, any of the competent people there simply regarded FTB as a lost cause, or at least a cause not worth fighting for). 

Anyways, it turns out the 'cover story' for PC Lyers banning me was that I made an argument that existed nowhere outside of his head.

PZs saying he banned me for being a troll:

Title: PZ Myers and the Art of Shameless Dishonesty
Date: 2012-07-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=o1mLHdTsmPc
Description: The short version, PZ Myers gave me his personal assurances that I would have the freedom to talk about whatever I wanted on freethoughtblogs. I did talk about an issue that I thought FTB was way off base on (addressing sexism at conferences), and PZ Myers kicked me because of it.

Further a friend has now informed me that freethoughtblogs is changing its policy, and they do not intend to repeat the 'mistake' of giving people the freedom to talk about whatever they want again. *SLOW HAND CLAP FOR FTBs* 

You can send a tweet to PZ Myers by using @PZmyers

The longer version:
Yup, PZ Myers wrote to me giving me an ultimatum, 'please resign' with the childishly obvious subtext, else we will ban you from freethoughtblogs.

I was actually stunned by this as this was the same man who less than six months earlier when we first discussed this in DC had given me his personal assurances that freethoughtblogs (yes there are witnesses willing to corroborate this) didn't try to control content, and we were free to talk about whatever we wanted. You have to remember that the origin of freethoughtblogs was because PZ Myers wanted somewhere where he could post free of the controls of Nat. Geo.

The betrayal of academic integrity over something as transient as a disagreement with the opinion of the plurality on freethoughblog on their political stance on feminism seemed to me, well I've got to be honest, unbelievable. I really expected the man to act with some sense of academic integrity, and not to jettison it completely at the first opportunity.

There is also a litany of other reason why I do not hold freethoughtblogs in high regard. Chief among these was their pressure on me to yield to someone WHO STATED THAT THEY WERE USING COPYRIGHT LAW (not for protection of copyright) BUT TO STIFFLE DEBATE. Yes, ftb were quite happy to enable the tactics used by the likes of VFX, kent hovind, answers in genesis and a horde of others to stifle debate.
But thats a story for another day.

The rest of this vid is a brief excursion into ground I usually don't tread for strategic reasons. I'm just tired of those presenting sexism as some horrible injustice at atheist conferences (by reporting troll comments as symptomatic of a problem (other than not feeding the trolls)) when in reality its a very minor issue.

This takes focus away from more useful ventures, and also makes the community look like a bunch of incompetents, incapable of focusing on more important issues.

This is more just a video summary, I still have to process a lot of this video to make the 'top shelf' stuff. Might take a week or so. In the meanwhile enjoy the compilation :-)

So looks like Im almost ready to go. Im going to have at least 3 timelapses running of this. One in visual light (90mm mak. Cassigrain), one in H-alpha (Colorado 'personal solar telescope'), and one of everything else that's going on (180 degree fisheye).

I've dry tested the kit as much as I can, but it experience says that something always goes wrong with projects this complicated. 

Once again, many thanks to all those who have supported this channel over the years.

Description: Pakistan Blocks Twitter of Draw Mohammad Day 3, then reinstates it ~ 12 hrs later.

Covered by almost 1000 news articles.

Its difficult to imagine that without the previous Draw Mohammad days that with this level of public impact that there wouldnt have been some reaction akin to the burning down of half a dozen embassies that followed the first dozen or so drawings of Mohammad. Indeed after well over 10 000 drawings of mohammad, how can anyone get upset about just one more?

Every action counts, and the thousands of people who have drawn Mohammad, or tweeted Mohammad, have all had an effect.

Title: The Obscenity of Christianity
Date: 2012-05-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_Na_wcvqUOY
Description: Love thy neighbor as thy self, unless hes a Moabite or some thing, in which case feel free to slaughter them man, woman child and ox.

Yup the bible at times reads like the end of The Unforgiven. ' Any man I see out there, I'm gonna shoot him. Any sumbitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife, all his friends, and burn his damn house down.'

Now compare to Joshua 6:21
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.

The really obscene thing though is religion can make a sane man stand up in the front of an auditorium at Oxford University and justify the slaughter of children. I am still stunned that they just sat there while he calmly went through and explained why killing children as 'spoils of war' was actually a supremely moral act, and a joyous occasion for all involved in that this was the day that these children were to be blessed with the ultimate gift of having their earthly phase of life being terminated. Just to put this into a modern context, if any of these slaughters for 'God' had been performed using gas chambers, would there still be lines of christian queuing up to justify this by the infinite blessing the children received?

Title: Lying for Jesus!
Date: 2012-05-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=D9rmHfTQd5Y
Description: So I'm going over this video and I'm accused of deliberately omitting the dates to mislead people on Craigs publication record. Not only did that seem peculiar, the video had clearly been edited.

Yup, the William lane Craig supporter (thecartesiantheist) actually edited the dates out of the video then accused me of dishonestly omitting this. 
The original
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emZlovxLZUM&t=4m42s

The 'lying for jesus edit'
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NbnDYhpHkE&t=2m12s

This is so dishonest it beggar belief! Really REALLY beggar belief. The original video shows that I was completely honest. So he had to edit the video to take out all the honest information such that he could accuse me of omitting it.

Indeed I really wouldn't have noticed had I not interacted with him recently where he showed a comparable level on integrity. He made a video addressing DPR criticism of William Lane Craig. I suggested he turn up on the MSS to address those points. He messed me around, he wanted a one on one 'formal debate' (yeah this guy uses the word formal as much as nephilimfree), he wanted me to debate him now in the comments. I just gave up and left the comment 
'meh, the offer was made to give you the forum you have been repeatedly requesting. You elected to decline. That is all.'
It turns out that despite this CLEAR message, he turns up to the show anyways, vocally claiming we had agreed to have him on. Even more ironically, because he was so late to the show (about an hour late), he spent all of his time in waiting room 3 and no one was even aware that he was there.
He has since been going around spinning this story in a not dissimilar way to the above video, that we had agreed to have him on (not true), that we knew he was there (not true) and that we were cowards etc etc. The moral of the story is clear, if you are going to eat tuna, expect bones, and if you are going to deal with a apologist, expect dishonest!

Title: The Art of PROFESSIONAL stupidity! (Eric Hovind)
Date: 2012-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-xmYYnE_7ck
Description: Presuppositional apologetics laid bare!

The core of the argument is, 'my proof that god exists is that I assume that god exists'. Yup, I believe we have reached the apex of lazy arguments for god.

Eric Hovind looks to be trying to make a name for himself with the 'great argument' for god. Now having seen Erics track record, I don't think I'm far from the mark when I say Eric, with his years of home-schooling from his daddy, the convicted tax-fraudster Kent Hovind, has be scouring the place for an argument so simply that he can make it, and he's found it in Presuppositional apologetics. Now, according to him, he doesn't need to know anything, all he needs to do is assume that god exists, and therefore god exists. He also needs to assume the bibles contents are true. Now of course to 'prove' something exists by assuming it exists is worthy of a wold class stupidity award. Eric is aware of this too, in that he wouldn't accept the presupposition that the ghost that never lies exists as proof for the ghost that never lies.

I also managed to dig up Ray Comforts original video about bananas prove the existence of god (the one which he subsequently claimed was a joke..... a bold faced lie if ever there was one). In this video he also claims that apples prove the existence of god! Funny stuff! :-)

Description: For those who don't get the title, Eric Hovind put up his copy of the video under the title of 'OFFICIAL'. What makes it official? Nothing, its simply Eric trying to score a little attention, and yeah, sure under the circumstances I have nothing against a little honest reciprocation. FYI Eric will get the attention he craves. Just as did Venomfangx, Nephillmfree, Kent Hovind, Ray Comfort and many others who have prominently featured in the 'Why do People Laugh at Creationists' series. He's going to have to wait his turn to become infamous though, as 38 and 39 are already works in progress. 

Eric Hovind, the Atheist, also does that 'ladies and gentlemen'- addressing the crowd- shockofgod type thing. 

Yup, when someone acts in that bad a faith, you really shouldn't be surprised to find out you are dealing with a Hovind.

Many thanks for the guy who gave me an SD card to record WBC, and to all the other great people I met at the Reason Rally. 

Also many thanks to Thethinkingatheist, who actually spent some of his time at the Rally getting footage rather than trying to talks some sense into folks like Hovind.

http://asadullahali.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/the-inhumanity-of-human-rights/


This channels been at the front in so many conflicts, I've got to be honest. I'm stunned its still here.

When Creation Science Ministries went DMCA happy.... first in line.

When Anonymous went for Scientology... right in the front line there too!

Two conflicts with Youtube, both, surprisingly resolved by everything getting reinstated (well to be fair, what was being asked for was little more than what was reasonable, but still)

Two DMCAs against Viacom,

One DMCA battle with the chronic DMCA abuser Venomfangx (resolved by him reading an apology)

One DMCA battle with the DMCA abuser Drcraigvideos (DMCA won, after serious attempts to take him to court, he 'quit' youtube)

Having my docs dropped by the 'moderate muslim' Dawahfilms. Having Dawahfilms try to get me fired by contacting my workplace. The guy is now claiming that human rights are inhuman as they do not tolerate absolute religious views (you know, human sacrifcie by the Aztecs and so forth). This is the same 'moderate muslim' who MANY youtubers vigorously supported on the basis that I was being a irrational, islamophobic bigot etc etc.

Anyway, now that I really don't have anything to stop me from revealing what work I do, a few keywords would have been enough. Also, several of my subscribers had worked this out completely independently. Some excellent and astute observations to which they need to be credited with. It also speaks to their integrity that they did not choose to reveal it to anyone.

Title: Facing Execution for Three Tweets
Date: 2012-03-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HKNwTDFvfps
Description: MANY THANKS to all those who supported this channel recently. 

After a tense moment, youtube reappraised the situation and reinstated the videos they had 'impartially reviewed' as inappropriate. 

Personally I think this would have gone nowhere without the overwhelming support of those who supported the message. 

A dangerous game to play though for sure, playing hardball with the forum that can delete you channel and everything on it in a few key strokes. 

Anyway, youtube reinstated the videos, showing what is tolerable as free speech on this forum. Risks were taken to make that line visible. Use the free speech that so many fought for! 

Which brings us on to Hamza Kashgari, the man who is currently facing a death sentence over 3 tweets saying something particularly bland about Mohammad and religion. 

I still find it sickening that a culture exists on this world today that has iphones and will still happily sentence people to death for tweets or behead them for being a witch. 

Anyway, over this last week we had a choice of either to concede ground on the open market place of ideas or fight to preserve them. We fought, and we attained everything that could have possibly been hoped for. 
Thank you!

I just can't believe youtube's really changing its policy this badly. Sure the terms of service have long essentially defined everything as hate speech while encouraging people to voice controversial opinions (yes very mixed messages!). In practice this means the policy is defined by how its enforced. Up till recently I thought youtube did an excellent job of allowing vibrant discussion of controversial topics:- a mature and responsible policy that would make anyone who espoused the virtues of the Enlightenment happy! 

Then I got four videos taken down in half an hour, and a 'privacy notifications' against a further two. Believe it or not, the privacy notifications were against videos where I documented a muslim guy hunting for and dropping my docs. WTF, seriously W-T-F. 
He drops my docs, YT scarcely bats an eyelid, now he says the video calling him on it is violating his privacy? 

The following videos were taken down, according to YT after review by their dedicated members who determined these videos violated terms of use. This can only make sense if its 'Youtube-Malaysia: Theocratic Chapter'. Malaysia is the place that recently sent a guy back to Saudi where he may face death for merely making three vanilla tweets about Islam. For me it doesnt seem impossible that there is an element of disconnect between what 'Youtube Malaysia' and the rest of the world regard as religiously offensive. 

I can only hope that it really is this simple, that it's just an error by an overzealous censor. If its a change in policy, its an ill wind that doesn't blow anyone any good.

Title: The BEST emotional PORN
Date: 2012-02-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nSqJ-7tg0Eo
Description: Most people will look at communal animals, and their need to be in groups will be outstandingly obvious. However people are that taken up by the first person perspective of life, that they don't immediately recognize their own biological need to be in groups. Its not just a preference, its biologically hardwired into your brain. Being with friends is good, and being with powerful friends is even better. It is therefore unsurprising that if you are going to fantasise about a friendship, that as the rewards are better for having a powerful invisible friend, than a weak one, that most people end up having a 'relationships' with an ultrapowerful god. 

It is hard to contest that there are real emotional rewards yielded from such fantasies, and I have no problem with that. However when these fantasies have destructive effects on the society around those who hold them it becomes an issue. Indeed the extent to which such fantasies can pervert and corrupt a member of society are aptly summed up in William Lane Craig. Arguably the strongest interpersonal behavior is that of protecting infants. William Lane Craigs religion perverts his behavior to such an extent that he will happily justify putting a sword through a babies skull with a smile on his face and a tune in his heart knowing that, according to his fantasy, that the infant received an infinite good as a consequence of him killing it.

So I sent this video to YT. 

Their reply was swift, and apathetically indifferent. Paraphrasing, 'if you think the dmca is false, file a counter notice'. 

And sure they are under no obligation to do anything, although they have just demonstrated by their actions that 10 dmcas evidently filed in bad faith with no consideration for fair use (see Lenz v. Universal Music Corp., 572 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1154-55 (N.D. Cal. 2008)) is not considered a pattern of abuse worthy of the sanctions youtube states that it would implement in the case of abuse. 

In essence youtube has just demonstrated that they are unwilling to take action against even flagrant abuse of the DMCA and the sanction they threaten, of termination of the account, is one that youtube is either too apathetic or too unwilling to enact.

I sent him 5 emails 
I left him a voicemail 
I even contacted the moderator on his forum, filling him in on the issue concerning allowing drcraigvideos to open claim on William Lane Craigs forum that he was legally acting as his agent in this copyright issue. 

The moderators reaction was to ban me within about an hour, and to delete every mention of the DMCA from the Reasonable Faith 'Open Forum' 

For a man who parades himself as being both an academic and a scholar, such activity is pathetic.

Title: William Lane 'Two Citations' Craig, Academic Midget
Date: 2012-01-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=emZlovxLZUM
Description: William Lane Craig likes to think of himself as an academic, an intellectual and if you believe his fans, 'is regarded by many as one of the worlds leading in Christian Apologetics'. Well that's all fine and dandy until you actually check out William Lane Craigs track record in the peer review literature. See it turns out that William Lane Craig is a champion in academic circles only in the category of publishing 'uncitable junk'. 
In academia 'the size of your balls' is largely determined how many papers you've written, and how many citations they pick up: basically how many interesting papers you've written. Turns out William Lane Craigs papers pull in on average about 2 citations, with his top citated work pulling something like a dozen citations. That's an absolutely farcical track record. Personally I find it difficult to see how the man can have such a high opinion of himself when his citations record is so poor. Indeed, by this metric, I've know people who have surpassed the entire contribution of WLCs academic career merely a couple of years after getting a PhD. 

Normally I would let this sort of thing slide, apart from the man is such a professional slimeball in his dealings with the likes of Richard Dawkins that I figure his dirty little secret needs a little exposure. I mean with an ego like Craigs, you know the one thing that will cut his ego deeper than any insult is rubbing his nose in his utterly lack-luster citations record. 

Personally I think he should hereafter be referred to as William Lane 'Two Citations' Craig, or he gets antsy about his credentials, Dr 'Two Citations' Craig.

Description: Sorry to put this out with such short notice. I had wanted to get this done about a month ago but just been too busy. 

So youtube, and the ISS are looking for good ideas for outreach projects to do on the ISS. Well I've got a good idea. The idea is that from an orbital platform, there are certain portions of the sky to which you get 24/7 views. If a planet's in that window, then you can record a very long time lapse of it. A stripped down 12 in telescope would provide perfectly adequate resolution for a project like this. After that you can database the data and recompile it into any timescale you want. This would provide the first long term views on the seasonal changing of the Jovian atmosphere (the bands appearing and disappearing), dust storms on Mars, the idling clouds of Venus and so-on. The changes in the timescale will not just give people a far more intimate feel with their celestial back yard, it will bring the solar system into dynamic life in a way that Hubble never did. 

Unfortunately I'm too old to enter the contest, so I'm putting the idea out there s 'up for grabs'.

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists? (part 37) William Lane Craig
Date: 2011-12-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4u6Mz21jTaA
Description: William Lane Craig is a master of crowing over the essentially irrelevant robust nature of certain methodologies while simultaneously misapplying such methods to draw his desired and erroneous conclusions. 

In academic circles, anyone who spends a disproportionate amount of their time exhausting the praises of the reliability of logical methods (as Craig does), reeks of being a bullshit merchant as its well known the whole methodology is subject to GIGO... Garbage in, Garbage out. 

Craig has 'five pillars' by which he 'proves' Christianity. Here, in Why Do People Laugh at Creationists Part 37, William Lane Craig, I address merely the first of these 'pillars'. He claims that everything that begins to exist has a cause. Well if we didn't have a few hundred years of scientific discovery under our belt showing the universe does not mold itself around human intuitions, he might have a point: however that's just not the case! The smaller and higher in energy you get, the less intuition serves you satisfactorily. And whats the problem Craig wants to apply his 'intuition' and 'inductive reasoning' to? Oh yeah, the beginning of the universe, where all of the energy/ matter of the universe was in pretty much the smallest volume we can conceive. He seems to expect that even though we have no way of currently defining such a state (it's an unknown, a gap in knowledge), that his intuitive reasoning will serve him well. You don't need to know much about science to realize that's almost a pointless exercise. Apply intuition to quantum mechanics, and you will fail. Similarly with relativity. 

These are of course the scientific objections to Craigs arguments. Craig is of course merely a layman when it comes to science. A point I only bring up as Craig persistently brings up such appeals to authority when suggesting his critics are not serious because they do not possess a degree in Philosophy. 

Ozmoroid has some of the best vids out there for those who really want to get to grips with relativity!

Title: Carl Sagan vs William Lane Craig
Date: 2011-11-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=reMjgNeYsOE
Description: This is a sort of teaser for WDPLAC pt 37, William Lane Craig.

The contrast between the metered maturity of Carl Sagan and the sneering school child of William Lane Craig is stark.

Craig, all but gleeful to dismiss those who merely ask for consistency between his treatments of unknowns. 
Where did the universe come from? (begging the question to begin with), but Craig handwaves and uses his 'god' to explain this unknown.

However rejects the idea that this god needs a cause. 

Sagan of course hits the nail on the head straight away. Why not just be honest and say its an unknown. Why all the posturing to replace an unknown with 'god'. What is wrong with the humility of merely saying 'we do not have a good explanation yet. It is an unknown.

It can be downloaded for free at:

The protein data band is run by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics: 

http://www.pdb.org/ 

Start vmd and Goto extentions, data, pdb database query 

type in the accession code 1hho 

and click on load into new molecule in vmd 

go to graphics - represenations 

delete the 'all', and type 'proteins' then hit return (all case sensitive) 
There you go there's the amino acids of your hemoglobin protein! 
Now lets find the magic heme that gives it that excellent ability to carry oxygen 

and click on create rep (representation), now type in 'resname HEM' and change the draw method to VDW, thats van der waals (all case sensitive). 

The green guy in the middle is the iron. That's where the oxygen binds. and when it does that's what gives your blood its red color. 

Change the protein representation from lines to new ribbon, and change the color method from name to chain. 

Now we can see that in this protein structure there are actually two molecules! each one with a heme group. 

Now lets find our oxygen. Click on the hem representation and click and add 'OXY' to it, then hit return! 

There you go... oxygen... without this protein, your blood would only be able to carry about 1 hundredth of the oxygen it does. 

You have about a million million red blood cells pumping around your body, each one of which contains a third of a billion tetrameric hemoglobin molecules. 

Each hemoglobin molecules is about a billion times smaller than you (~1nm to 1m). 

Just to put that into perspective, the ratio of size of a hemoglobin molecule to you is about the same ratio as your height (1m), to the distance to the moon! (1Gm)

I do use a few clips of his video, videos that he himself uploaded to YouTube. Part of the privacy removal process states that I am not allowed to disclose any information that has not been publically made available by DawahFilms himself. He put his own face on YouTube, I am merely responding to things he has said and done towards me. 
Also at the same time I received this privacy notice, I got 4 other videos flagged down which I do not seem to be able to appeal.

Title: Amenakin, Censorin' For Islam
Date: 2011-10-02

Description: http://www.mediafire.com/?2rqa1mark957jyv

I've got a lot of issues with organized religions that use socially coercive behaviors in an Islamic heavy population to prevent people from leaving. Islam is WAY out there in terms of the levels they are willing to go to to enforce conformity, up to and including executing people. I mean not even the Scientologists or Mormons are that crazy. Can you imagine it if Scientology decrees that anyone who leaves the 'Church' shall be executed?

Islam basically wrote the rule book on socially coercive techniques to be used in 'market dominance' sitations. The most obvious one being praying 5 times day. The bell rings, and you will stand out if you don't get on your knees and pray. Same with the head-wear for women, and the beard thing for men. Naturally when you look at it in terms of what the hell would an all powerful 'God' want with any of these things, its bloody silly:- WAY beyond comically ridiculous. However this seems to be a thought that is absent presumed missing in many muslim heads such as Amenakin here who actively embraces such techniques, and in doing so she makes it that much harder for other women in her community to escape the oppression of women in Islam that is arguable the worst in the modern age.

However that's not my prime reason for making this video. This girl (Amenakin) has been abusing the DMCA, and I'm not going to stand by and allow the precedent to be set that some Islamic girl, offended by potholer54 calling bullshit on her pseudo science ramblings, should use the DMCA as a way of censoring for Allah.

Simple meta-stable fiscal feedback mechanism. 

A one trillion dollar budget can afford to spend a minisucle amount of its budget, either explicitly or indirectly to exert enough pressure in Washington to be cost effective. 

So here's the crazy suggestion, why not take that trillion dollar military budget. Is that really value for money? 
Why not take half of that money and buy a shit load of health service for america. It will reduce the financial pressure the military sector can exert and it will make america a happier and healthier place. I mean really, where do you thing you will get value for money there?

'Supernova of a Generation!' 
http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/astronomers-discover-the-supernova-of-a-generation-20110827/ 
There is a supernova in M101, a relatively nearby galaxy (some 20 million light years away). The galaxy is quite bright and in the constellation of ursa major (the great bear, or big dipper). Now by pure chance I had taken a picture of M101 about a month ago, so the position of the supernova can be easily seen. Further I was out there last night, basically doing the same thing again, and I could actually see it 'live at the eyepiece' with my 11in Schmidt cassigrain. However eyes are fairly sensitive to this sort of thing, and it's likely that it will be a while yet before I can get 'video' of this at the eyepiece. However I have got a 'deep sky' video camera that should do the job. 

And yup, figure Im going to have a go at doing a time lapse on this one. The problem with time lapse of the sky is things tend to be a long way away, so they have to move a long way for you to see anything. Practically that means there ain't much you can do, especially if you only have 8 hrs of dark. I've already had a go at the moon, Jupiter and Uranus, but this is a golden opportunity! The chance to do a timelapse of a distant galaxy! By some reckoning this is a once in generation supernova.

Uranus is frequently overlooked and for many reasons. Firstly, lets just say its name hasn't phonetically aged well. Secondly it's small and faint, barely visible to the naked eye, and even the most powerful telescopes show little more than a tiny featureless grey-green disk. 

Most powerful telescopes will show the five main moons of Uranus, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon. The innermost of these Miranda, which has, if memory serves the highest cliffs in the solar system (due to being previously (presumably) smashed by an impact) and has an orbital period of about 1.5 days. That means you should be able to easily see its movement over a night. 

So it was that I set out with my scope on the evening of 22nd Aug 2011 to see what could be captured. I decided to head up to an observatory site that had previously seemed good up near the top of the somewhat active volcano, Lassen Peak. The site is high, almost 2 miles up, but the seeing was less than perfect (a very constant ~ 5mile an hour wind, which was probably a blessing in that it bought warmer air from somewhere, but was also a curse due to the wind chill- I was surrounded by snow fields!). Nonetheless, at prime focus of the 11in CPC1100 with ~1000 iso and 4 second exposure on a canon 60D seemed to bring out easily at least 4 of the moons of Uranus. 

After that, I just had to maintain the kit for 8 or so hour. A pain in the ass, as there were several pieces of kit that all need to work or the night would be 'lost'. So you basically have to periodically check all the batteries on the various time lapse and tracking kit are working functionally. The bottom line is you can actually get quite a lot of sleep, but its horribly disjointed, the practical upshot of which was the next day I was wiped out to the point where I had actually planned to head up into Oregon to do something, but for the first time ever on a road trip I did something I'd never countenanced before. I stayed a night in a motel!! First time in 5 years! A motel 6 I should add! All I wanted was somewhere where I could get a shower, a bed for the night, and damn, just sit back for a moment, put my feet up, and have a glass of wine......ahhhhhh. 

I was REALLY happy when I processed this, not really for what I had hoped to achieve, which was to get the motion of the moons, as while it was visible, it wasn't that great. But what great the motion of the whole Uranus system against the background stars. I knew this MIGHT be visible, but I really didn't expect it to looks as cool as it did! Now it should be said that most of the motion you see here is probably not due to the motion of Uranus, but due to the motion of the Earth. Nonetheless, its still really cool!

The observation that virtually all religions are power based male hierarchies is very telling and suggestive. 

The most obvious suggestion for the origin of such hierarchies is that they are the best way to combat the nastiest enemy such a species can face, and that's a power based hierarchy of the same species. 

If you then make the simple assumption that these are the cause and effect, religion then becomes a surrogate spinoff of this biological attribute. Not dissimilar to the reason we have pornography. The porn may not actually hit the actual target the metabolism was tuned for, but it does deliver the satisfaction that the biological mechanism was tuned for.

Description: This video was actually 'recorded live' so to speak, under the silver arch! The silence you hear, is the silence of the dark night in a clearing way up high in the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. -Quite a profound and moving experience. 

The Man Under the Silver Arch. 

He stands, that all he does, static under the silver arch as the universe courses through his brain. 

He sees it all from galactose to galaxies. He sees the nuclei, and the wavefunctions of the electrons. The free energy minima spanning orders of magnitude and different fundamental forces. The bound states of the nuclei, the electrons, the molecules into the kinetic arena of the non-converged states of life. The electron imbalances and the cascades of his nervous system leading him to conceive both those imbalances and the universe exterior to them. 

He feels the density gradient beneath his feet and the thousand fold less dense gas pressing on him. He feels it in the gravitational gradient of the earth, and sees the pressure drop to that of space a hundred miles above his head. 

All of a sudden, the man under the silver arch is lost as the earth drops away to reveal the nearby star, the thermonuclear furnace of which is primarily responsible, for fuelling the thoughts he is currently thinking. The static stars begin to show signs of parallax as he drifts through the galaxy, then out of it to the orders of magnitude beyond. 

He blinks, and all of a sudden, he is just the lone man, standing on the mountain under the star light sky. Beautiful pin pricks of light on the velvet black. 

The man under the silver arch smiles:- the Universe, its fuckin'

I have no torch on me, and no weapon (normally I carry both a torch and a big ass knife, which in the event of you not being killed outright is enough to put some pretty respectable sized holes in a cat). But I have neither. I have the camera, and now that I think about it, I should have grabbed the tripod too, but I didn't. Keeping myself fixed towards where the sound was I made my way cautiously back to the car, brandishing the 2000 dollar camera n lens as just a big metal lump (strange how the value of objects can be changed by merely the snapping of a twig in a clearing on a quiet night up). On getting back to the car, I quickly rummaged around and got a knife, and flashlight. I panned it around the clearing to see two bright green sapphire eyes looking back at me from behind a log. It had come up on me from where I first heard it on the far side of the clearing. It could only have been about 10 meters. Then behind it I saw a second pair of eyes, as green as the first, but smaller, and further off. Green eyes are cats eyes, and from the separation and the distance I could tell this was a big cat. After watching me for a few seconds I saw it turn off into the trees. I didn't like that at all: all the time I could see it, I knew what the score was. A big cat out of sight, thats more of a worry.
I fumbled around for a video camera, but by that time they eyes had gone and again I was 'alone in the quiet'. After that I was reluctant to leave the car. Mountain lions are ambush hunters, and the car was awkwardly positioned such that getting out was 'vunerable'. I slept the night away, and in the morning went looking for tracks. Turns out there was a deer path that went along side the opening, and sure enough, there were mountain lion tracks there, further they tracked up towards the tripod.

Description: So if you're driving across the US and you fancy a spot of radio, in the 'no-where' lands you typically get a choice of country n western, or christian radio.

So yeah, I actually listen to quite a lot of christian radio. It's in this fashion that I've acquired quite a reasonable idea of 'what sells' christianity in america, and it aint pretty.

In the current case, this guy was right in the middle of blaming the Japanese tsunami as divine judgement when I turned on the camera.

However, even on the bit I caught, it's amazing how readily this guy was to exploit millions of unfortunate natural deaths were in fact due to his 'god' trying to communicate, simply to sell his religion. I mean I expect it's possible to go lower, but I'd have to think how.

Description: Rick Perry is having a prayer convention to correct the problems that he was too incompetent to solve, and that it was his job to solve! 

Now it must be said that Gov. Perry has no faith in prayer to solve anything. I can tell you for certain when he gets a flat tire, his first thought is not 'damn, I must not have prayed hard enough, and the only solution is to pray some more'. Nope, he calls AAA or fixes it himself. 

So why does he think, given that prayer is ineffective at solving small stuff, that it can fix big stuff. My guess is he probably doesn't, but it plays well with the unwashed masses of the faith over facts brigade that constitute a significant amount of texas's population, and it's required if the man wants to run for president that he has the backing of the religious right. 

However the sad thing is there is a religious right, for who this will be 'That Rick Perry has faith, I should vote for him'.

Title: From Blowing up Sodium, to removing it from the sky!

Description: Los Angeles looks kind of pretty from up on Mount Wilson, with the lights sparkling a mile or so below. However it puts all but the greater stars to pale. Now there really is no substitute for a dark, still, clear observing site, but if you can't get to one of those, a light pollution reduction filter is a good option. Y'see sodium lights run on the emission of an change in the electronic states of sodium, with the practical upshot being that the light is essentially monochromatic (a single wavelength). Now that gives some hope for the astronomer in that if you can get a narrow band filter, you can get rid of most of the light pollution while still getting most the light from the stars. That's the contrast that I show in this video. Also, for good measure, what the sky is like from a dark observing site up in the Sierra Nevada.

Title: BIG sodium explosion (40g)
Date: 2011-08-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sieb6l2WRFk
Description: Turns out only about half of the sodium in this reaction, actually reacted with the water. The remainder was ejected from the reaction, heated but unmelted! This reaction just gets more and more interesting. Had a similar thing with a potassium reaction too. 

The music used (Tyrad Breath) is available for use under a creative commons, attribution license (http://www.jamendo.com/en/download/track/26737/?output=contentonly), and is used as such. 

The sodium was wrapped in aluminium foil and weighed on a line, giving me the chance to do this reaction from a VERY respectable distance. As you can see it not only destroys the ~5 liter plastic container, but it also sprays molten sodium around. Thats the sort of thing it good to be a very respectable distance from.

Description: There's a reason why I started with 250 mg (1/4gram) of potassium. When dealing with potentially hazardous stuff, you need to have a good feel of what the hazards are. 

The scale-up went 1/4 g, ~1.5g, then 8 grams. The 8 grams did not destroy the shatter resistant jug, but it sure made a mess of the plastic container on which it stood. What you see in this video is a concerto of chemistry and physics. However I'm currently on the road, and really don't have much time or resources to make a detailed video about it at the moment. Will hopefully get something out later though :-)

Description: Rolled on down to Cripples Creek, beautiful place, but unfortunately now turned into some sort of gambling resort. Mind you, the place is pretty, but built on a gold rush that ended over a hundred years ago. Decided to head out to the south towards Canon. The GPS kept trying to divert me down a dirt road I didn't want to go down, so I kept going on the paper map, until it appeared the GPS was right. However after only a few hundred yards the blacktop ended and I was on a dirt road I didn't really want to be on with some 29 miles left.. AG! Clock was a ticking so I decided to keep rolling forward. Initially it was easy through fairly flat forest, but then the terrain got progressively more impressive, then incredibly impressive. I just couldn't figure out what such an impressive dirt road was doing going through the middle of nowhere. The drive was stunning and thankfully very short of cars coming in the other direction. This is what I love about America, its not so much the things you know are there, it's the things you don't. Lost and just looking for a way back to the main road, and you come across a gem like this!

Description: if you find it hard to watch, pity me, I had to sit through this shit!

Blog entry @ 
http://www.thunderf00t.org

Friday 8th July, the Phelp interview. The main reason I thought the Phelps would be fun would be a passage in Luke (also in another gospel I think), where Jesus is describing the end times. Two men in a bed! Jesus says you can get raptured if you are two men in one bed! I also listen to a load of xian radio going across country, and I could make such a great gay sermon from this.

'Remember Lotts Wife! This is clearly a reference to not looking back, and the very next line is about two men in a bed. Jesus is quite clear about his choice of sexes here, he could have said a man and his wife, he could have said a mother and her child, but no, its two men in ONE bed, ONE bed, signifying the one-ness of the two men... etc etc'. This is always what bugs me when people start blathering about being 'scholarly' in Christianity. I've listened to the scholars, and yes of the stupidity they issue forth, this (two men in ONE bed) comment wouldn't even register above the noise!

Anyway bear in mind it was just an idea, and that I had driven from Columbus to Kansas city the previous day, and had no time to prepare at all.

They were very courteous when they greeted me, Megan and Megan, one young and pretty, the other as ugly as her opinions.

I had hoped to try and keep it all on a civilized, clear and logical level, but it became almost instantly obvious that this was a lost cause. The hostility of 'Meg the Eldar' was really something I was unprepared for. The volume, the amount, and the hostility in the pitch of her voice was that of a bitter, bitter woman. Like a dog that's been tormented daily till all it knows how to do is attack anything that comes within biting distance. The daughter, I had the feeling was only there for eye-candy, or was just there as a spectator so Meg the Eldar could show her how to properly hate something not of the cult. The daughter spoke softly and had it just been me and her we might have made some progress. She had a venomfangx look to her. Every argument had a 'memorized by rote' unthought through answer, but given time it might have been possible to untangle some of the mess. But alas, Meg the Eldar, from the very start was throwing in pointless insults at every opportunity, 'your nothing special' 'your country is worthless' 'your mother...' etc etc. Water off a ducks back for me of course, I've had more shit thrown at me than that before. Battle-hardened to the childish feces flinging :-) . Eventually, I decided that Meg the Eldar could not be allowed to streamroller the events by doing 90 % of the talking, only 5% of which was relevant, but when I accosted her about it she threatened repeatedly to leave.

Realizing that she essentially had the trump card of just walking out, I went for the 'Jesus endorses homosexuality' gambit.

It hit the spot, and they 'RAGE-QUIT'. The great thing was though that Meg the Eldar acknowledged that women should be grinding mill with rocks when the rapture happens.

PWNED BITCH.

After that back on the road, and drove for a LONG time. Made it to Colorado Springs by dusk, and stopped off at a coffee shop to upload some stuff, catch up with email etc. But by this time I was a spent wraith. My plan had been to head up to the mountains and find some quiet forest road to park on. Eyeballing the map 'Cripples Creek' looked fun. Boy did I get it wrong. I was expecting things to get quiet and empty very quickly. Not a bit of it, turns out its all ski resorts etc up there. Nothing worse that having to drive on and on and on in the dark when you are exhausted. But alas no alternatives. Eventually gave up and found a larger siding and just crashed out. I had figured the traffic would die off quickly after midnight, but not a bit of it. There was a steady stream of cars, every minute or so throughout the night. I just couldn't figure it out. Where were they coming from and going too? To me this looked like a road to nowhere. At any rate I woke up in the night to see Jupiter rising over the mountains. First time I've seen him this year! Hopefully nearer opposition I will get a team together to do a global planetary timelapse!

On the road I will be putting a journal up of my tour of the US on: 
http://www.thunderf00t.org 

So why does 7 grams of lithium release more energy than 130 g of cesium reacting with water. 

Well 7 g of Li and 130 g of Cs contain about the same number of nuclei. Now you could just do the experiment of dunking both of these into water, and seeing which generates the most heat. Its a little impractical due to the cost of cesium. The violence of the reaction probably wouldnt be that big of a problem. Cesium melts at almost room temperature, so you just put it in a syringe and inject it into water. 

However one of the nice things about chemistry is that it allows us to calculate things. In this case we can calculate the relative energy of Cs and Li dissolving in water. 

Li(m) + H2O = Li+(aq) +.5H2 +OH-(aq) 

Cs(m) + H2O = Cs+(aq) +.5H2 +OH-(aq) 

Well as we are doing a comparison, there are components that are energetically equivolent in both these equations so we can cancel them. 

Li(m) = Li+(aq) 

To calculate this we need to know three values, the energy to atomize the metal, the energy to strip an electron off it, and the energy to dunk that atomized ion into water at infinite dilution. Thankfully chemists are nerdy types and all these values are known. 

Put the numbers in and you find that Li(m) and Cs(m) reacting with water are virtually energetically identical. However in the case of equal masses of Li and Cs, the lithium will release about 20x as much energy (as you have 20x as many atoms). 

So why does one explode and not the other. I think several factors are relevant. 
1) the area of water: metal contact. Lithium floats v. high in the water, and only areas of contact generate heat. Cesium sinks like a rock. 
2) Cesium boils a lot easier than lithium. 
3) Ill bet, but dont know, that Cs has a much lower surface tension. This means its far easier for cesium to get a standing wave on its surface that encloses an drop of water (I think causing the explosion). If the metal has a very high surface tension this cannot happen without much bigger drops. 

Bottom line is, I've got to get the cameras closer to the action to work it out, and regrettably that's not going to happen for months. 

I'm heading out on the road, and trading the roof of bricks and mortar for that of dark night and bright stars.

It's been bugging me for a long time that alkali metals explode. That shouldn't happen in a heterogeneous reaction. 

In trying to work this out, its become more and more intreging! 

The metal explodes at near speed of sound (detonation). But even more interesting, it gives off green gas, up to the point the metal is incandescent (~600C). 

Still not sure what causes the explosion. Standing waves on the molten surface? The metal boiling. Nothing quite fits. 

The green gas however it turns out has been known for a LONG time, well over a hundred years as being related to potassium vapor. Ask the question why is it green, and I've drawn a blank. Can't find anything. 

Modern research has done quite a lot with dipotassium (electronically similar to hydrogen), but these are not the brute experiments of old of heating tubes up to red heat and eyeballing it. 

I suspect, but don't know that the green gas is dipotassium. It's electronic configuration is similar to that of chlorine. Chlorine is green due to the raleigh scattering (same thing that makes the sky blue). If the polarization of Cl2 and K2 was similar, the colors would be similar. That would of course put Na2 being a much lighter green. It's not, its blue. 

So what are the alternatives? Solvated electron would be a credible explanation for the current water case, but according to the ancient literature, you get the same vapor when you distill potassium. 

ARSE! Still there are a lot of eyes and minds out there! Hopefully one of them will spot the obvious that I am missing.

Title: Potassium is EVIL
Date: 2011-06-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eYiNSDK6UWU
Description: Potassium has been described as 'evil', and the description isn't far off.

While the reaction of potassium with water is one of the most widely seen of all chemical reactions, with almost everyone who has sat through a chemistry class witnessing this reaction. However that doesn't mean it has nothing of interest left to offer.

Its widely stated that the reaction is mostly K + H2O = KOH + 1/2H2, but that's a heterogeneous reaction. It's very difficult to see how you are going to get a detonation out of that! Nonetheless, a reaction occurring at near the speed of sound is observed..

Further, I cannot find any reference to colored gas being evolved by the reaction of potassium with water, but it clearly is! What is this gas? What gives it it's color, well I don't know yet, and as far as I can tell, noone else does either! Welcome, to the unknown!

FYI, the 'Potassium is Evil' guy is quite right.
As is clear from the guy who actually got quite lucky with misjudging the potassium reaction. I can tell you from experience that such explosions fire molten potassium in all directions. Facemask would have been prudent, as would not trusting in long tongs and arms length (meh, everyones a general after the battle!).

Description: Derogatory photoshopping of people you can, in most cases get away with as satire. However if you are IMPERSONATING a person with intent to malign them, thats different.

It looks like previously permanently banned used coughlan666, aka coughlan616, aka coughlan000, aka TheDramaPimps, and user ferderalistfilms have been involved with doing to me. 

Coughlan of course has a long history of hating on almost everything. 
Thunderf00t is one of his prime targets. Probably the most frequent subject the guy makes videos about, and has certainly admitted to making photoshopped images of Thunderf00t with the intent of harassing him. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khLpVruE3QM time index 4:44 

I perceive his motivation as petty malice, and while youtube may view it differently, I have no problem whatsoever in allowing him to express himself as he sees fit. 

However, over time this malicious behavior has grown in scope, culminating recently in coughlan616 and friend apparently conspiring to create photoshopped pictures of me masturbating, and then to post them to a porn on a profile created under the name Thunderf00t. 

Coughlan616 is clearly heavily implicated in all of this. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JShF0_-RI3c 

The act of creating pornographically photoshopped images is highly questionable. Impersonation like this certainly crosses lines. 

Coughlan has been progressively increasing his attention seeking antics in an attempt to get a reaction out of me. 
He didn't get one as I simply didn't care. 

However when a group takes their photoshopping antics into the realm of porn and impersonation, with malicious intent, action is clearly required. 

Coughlan (Coughlan616, coughlan000, TheDramaPimps) is of course violating the rules simply by being here, in that he has previously been permanently banned as coughlan666. 

If actions such as this do not constitute a violation of the Community Guidelines, its difficult to see what would.

Description: So it looks like the YT Nextup thing has crashed n burned. 

That was disappointing, but not unexpected, with the most obvious factor being the way this channel vocally and unapologetically addresses dogma. 

Addressing dogma is necessary for stopping society from regressing. There is no point in building an ivory tower from the summation of the knowledge of mankind, an ivory tower capable of seeing the unknown, if while you were doing it, religious sorts have undermined its foundations and replaced it with the shifting sand of dogma. 

But thats not a commercial venture. 
YT is now a fierce attention economy, and on a trajectory where that competition will only intensify. 

Much though I hate to say it the days of when someone could do well on youtube as a hobby are fading fast. 

More by luck than judgment Ive ended up at the top of the hill of the non 'camera whore' rationalists. Thats good and bad. Means that I'm a target for every feces flinging attention whore- which is never fun, and the prime target for parasites. It also means that walking away will essentially discard a market share of the attention economy of the rationalist community, and given the trajectory YT is following, one that I am highly skeptical would ever be recovered. 

This basically means I have the tiger by the tail. Leaving a real career to perform financial suicide defending a 'rationalist' market share on the attention economy of youtube isnt the most appealing of proposals. Thats leaving aside the fact that I'm needed in the research world too. Similarly it would seem a remorseful waste to just let the channel die on the vine. 

-a revenue stream is needed- one that will allow me latitude of operation. It really is that simple.

Description: A 1000 degree fireball roars with a terrifying and seemingly unstoppable rage, but really how much more energy is that consuming than my body. 

Turns out being warm blooded (of the ilk of the mammals) is actually a very energetically costly business, consuming about 2 000 kcal/ day. 

-Indeed the calcs. performed here are significantly on the conservative side. 
NASA years ago worked out you need about 0.5 kg (1 lb) of oxygen to survive per day (useful number to have if you are going to be putting men in a giant can for about a week!). --You can assume that all 'burns' sugar and get you values from there. 
Or sugars burns to give you about 4kcal/g. 
According to that the 300 g of sugar in this video would keep you going at a regular metabolism for HALF a day. A few days if you take it easy. 

Either way the point is quite clear that merely running the metabolism requires a fearsome amount of energy!

1) allowing threats of violence to induced the required behavior, especially when that behavior is the compliance with religious dogma, is an atrocious precedent to set. 
2) of the limited actions available, defiant non-compliance will publicly show that threats of violence are an ineffective way of trying to threaten the west to comply with Islamic Law.

Title: 40 000 Qur'an copies Burn for Free Speech!
Date: 2011-04-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qeAr01hzG30
Description: There are those within the religion of Islam that think that their religious laws should be applied to the rest of the world under threat of force.
Recently, because pastor Terry Jones burned a koran, an Islamic mob stormed a United Nation compound and killed about 20 unrelated people, beheading two of them.
This sort of goal orientated religious mob violence MUST NOT BE SEEN TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR FREE SPEECH.
And in order to achieve this, I downloaded 40 000 copies of the Koran (Qur'an) onto a hard drive, then destroyed them, of a fashion with a touch from my finger.
Further, I created a 1000 degrees C fireball, just to be sure.
To my knowledge this is the largest Koran burning in history.

Title: Burning Half a Million Korans

http://www.islamway.com/SF/quran/
or here:
http://www.qurandownload.com/

This week in Afghanistan over 12 people were lynched because a Pastor in Florida burned the Qur'an.

While I disagree with his motives for doing this, there can be little argument that he has revealed that a large portion of the islamic world thinks that Islamic religious laws should apply to the rest of the world.

I am not Islamic. I am not subject to Islamic laws.

Doing nothing will not address this issue.

So the obvious choice of action is a mass decentralized action. The sort of thing that was successful with Draw Mohammad Day. But what to do.

It has to show the absurdity of this religious law in the digital age. The obvious thing is download the Quran and delete it. Well there are various options open. Create a half a million copies of the Koran and delete them. Well thats all very good and well, but I have a load of hard drives I need to decommission. The obvious thing is, prior to cracking them open, download as many copies of the Koran onto them as possible. Turns out thats about 50 000 Qurans in Arabic.

It must not be seen that threats of violence have resulted in the de facto application of Islamic law to the rest of the world. It would be an atrocious precedent to set.

Title: To Unify by Perception
Date: 2011-03-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7Eat9WiGH54
Description: When NASA did this sort of thing, it was an unintentional spinoff, albeit arguably the one that had the greatest impact on mankind, of a 100bn dollar project. 
NASA still provides this material without copyright. 

I think a global first is within our reach. 
Last year I did a 8 hr time-lapse of Jupiter as a proof of concept. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhPJHfR3Pco 
The wider goal was to unify the time-lapse streams from several such scopes (a global project) to create essentially a continuous time-lapse of Jupiter, along with various sites on Earth to really put people in touch with their spinning home and solar system. This would be the first time anything like this has ever been attempted. 
Personally I think it would be 'FRICKIN AWESOME' if this can be pulled off! 
The planets align later this year, and I had intended to start garnering support for this some time after Easter 2011 (post DMD2). This is not a trivial project. I'm also not rich enough to fund this one out of my own pockets which is one of the reasons I've been taking donations. 
Earlier this week I found out about the youtube Nextup program, and that it had a deadline of the end of the week! (27 March I think). It looks like youtube are essentially scouting for talent and are willing to put some funds that way. $35k and YT promotion would be useful incentives in getting the global interest of astronomers needed to take this one to the hoop. I put together what I could in the time I had available. 
Yeah I appreciate this might seem an odd time to release the video, but this one is working according to their schedule, not mine. 
The entry is meant to be accompanied by a 400 word 'essay'. 
This is what I submitted. 

- To unify the eyes of the world 
This project is intrinsically global in its nature, and will, upon its completion constitute a global first. 
Our technology has now advanced to the point where one man can, with modest resources, surpass what was a billion dollar superpower effort four decades ago. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhPJHfR3Pco 
-The images I have here of Jupiter in this video, while impressive, are actually well below the machine's capability, but regrettably I didn't have time to wait for good conditions, or to travel to an observatory site. Nonetheless this video demonstrates the proof of concept. 
I propose to implement this technology with the aim of recording a 24 hour timelapse of Jupiter from as many locations on Earth as possible. While all the components to make this project happen have been in existence for 5 or so years, no one has yet bought them together. 
Realistically $35 k is a secondary consideration for this project in that if this venture were to be attempted commercially it would probably cost about 5-10+ times this amount (4+ professional planetary imagers operating technical and expensive kit from four locations on the planet). 
Thankfully, many scientific institutes will be happy to help out pro-bono if the project is interesting, and plausible, and this project is both. The publicity the work is likely to garner (especially with Youtube/Google promotion) will probably be a deal clinching incentive. The ability to buy someone a few thousand bucks worth of kit (if necessary) is likely to be a significant (and relatively cost effective) sweetener/ facilitator. 
It is likely that this will have to happen from observatory sites, simply to increase the probability of clear skies. The good news is most observatories usually have 'small scopes' on site (large by amateur standards) that are perfectly capable of performing this sort of project. Further they usually have capable people operating them. 
-I am a credible research scientist, with a track record of producing popular and rigorous scientific videos that demonstrate I can pull this sort of thing off. It is likely, although not guaranteed, that I could garner the support of several observatories. 
The primary purpose of this project is to allow people to see things from a different mental vantage point. To graphically connect them, via new technology and media, with both the planet rotating beneath their feet, and the planets spinning above their heads. 
-Next year, Mars!

Title: DMD2: THIS TIME ITS ARMAGEDDON!
Date: 2011-03-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=61WjEd0y6zM
Description: It should be a collective badge of shame for our species that in this day and age, an age of space travel and genome sequencing, that you can still be sentenced to death merely for saying what you think about a religion. 
This year in Pakistan, that's exactly what happened: this is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed, and yes, sunlight is the best sterilant for this sort of thing, and I intend to give it plenty of both! 
This really is one of those 'why we protest' kind of things. The status quo is unacceptable, and to remain silent would simply constitute tacit acceptance of a stagnant status quo. 
About one in six on this planet are adherents to Islam, and Islam is the only religion that I know of that will: 
1) sentence people to death for blasphemy. 
2) have riots of thousands that will burn down embassies over cartoons. 
3) threaten the lives of cartoonists to the point where the threats are so credible that people have to go into hiding. 
4) that will have their leadership pull the plug on entire aspects of the internet because they fear the irrational response of their Islamic practitioners. 
5) that will have leaders of large Islamic countries suggest that merely burning the Koran would constitute a 'threat to global peace' 
-These are symptoms that Islam displays that other religions do not. Islam is different here, and thus requires to be addressed in a different fashion. 
History shows us that the incremental actions of thousands CAN change the views of great civilizations. It is time for us to realize that there is a problem, and our collective actions can apply a social pressure to significantly diminish the above detrimental attributes of Islam. 
This is why Draw Mohammad Day is returning. 
No more shall freemen and women be intimidated into silence by the irrational and violent behavior of religious practitioners. 
DMD2 will have its own website, the significant costs of which have already been underwritten by an several anonymous donor. 
This will mean that no-one can pull the plug on DMD2. 
The event will also be promoted through youtube and facebook.

Title: Girl prays to CAUSE Japanese earthquake
Date: 2011-03-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UcikNCsilHk
Description: Is she a Poe (basically a satirical 'Christian'). I think so, but that the whole point of the Poe, its impossible to tell. If all I had seen of Pat Roberson and Jerry Falwell was their post 9/11 interview (as shown in this video), I would have called them Poes too, and they are some of the most powerful and respected religious figures in the US (well Falwells dead, but you know what I mean). 

Normally I don't post links to smaller channels, but in this case I think folks deserve it to see if you think she's real or not. 

http://www.youtube.com/user/tamtampamela 

Like I say though. How could you tell that she's a fake, but Falwell and Roberson were not? 

Sure her 'prayers' to CAUSE this disaster will have been no more effective at causing it than other Christians prayers for it to be minimized. 

But it was religion that allows her to first of all define thousands to tens of thousands of people dying in Japan as a good thing. 

But her delusion in many ways is little different than the delusion that prayer will actually achieve something. 

Meanwhile Japans been doing something useful with their time, something that will have doubtlessly saved thousands, if not tens of thousands of lives. 

Japan is arguably the most technologically capable nation on Earth. The technology they have developed over the past hundred years or so will doubtless have saved thousands, if not tens of thousands of lives. 

If you have money, but not the time to work out how to best deploy it, MSF, Doctors without Borders are a fairly reputable lot who will probably make your dollar go a long way in the right direction.

Title: Christians say the Dumbest Things
Date: 2011-03-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HFw5TsAi1Mk
Description: Its bugged me for ever that Christians are proud of the 'fact' that the 'Lord is my shepherd'. (Psalm 23) 

It's one of the earliest things taught to children is that farm animals get eaten, and sheep are no exception. If the lord is their shepherd, he's not being nice to them just out of love or care, but because of their deadweight at market. 

Yup, and would you believe that psalm 23, -The Lord is my Shepherd, is one of the most quoted, and most read Bible verses. It's jaw droppingly, well funny I suppose that billions of christians have read this verse, and as far as I can tell none have them have put this verse together with what they learned when they were 5, that there is no happy ending for the sheep. 

If the verse is meant to confer the concept that their god will care for them, then a better metaphor would be 'The Lord is my Nanny'. Irrespective it embodies the concept that someone else will care for you, and there is no encouragement for self-improvement or development. In summary its a statement of pedomorphic desire and intent as a mainstay of the Christian religion. 

Ironically this would of course count as bad parenting anywhere. No good parent should encourage their children to remain children in perpetuity. The sole goal of the parents should be for their children to supersede their ability!

Well improvisation is the mother of invention, but more than that, improvisation can be fun.

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists? (part 36).
Date: 2011-02-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=By17QNKQQ44
Description: Its funny, it really is, well to be honest hilarious. I really didn't think PCS was serious when he claimed 'Ive found a scientific discovery that has been sourced to the bible, and that proves its divinely inspired' or similar. 

The sad thing is you don't even need to think about it long to realize that hes full of crap. 

So his line one item for 'showing the bible to be true' is a fragment of a poem from psalms. A line that involves divinely revealed insight about 'the fish of the sea' and the 'paths of the sea'. 

Turns out the arguments weren't even his own anyway. They were copied, word for word off other creationist website. This is doubtless why he doesn't appear on camera. 

So 'he' claims that the discovery of the ocean currents was directly due to the Bible, and a guy called Maury read the Bible, and then went off to discovery them. 

Problem one of course is there are no citations to this outside creationist scribblings. 

Problem 2 is that according to Maury himself, the gulf stream was known about at least 200 years before he looked at the problem (face-palm). 

Problem 3, ocean currents have been known about since antiquity. Its one of the first thing you notice when you get out on the sea in a dead calm is that there are ocean currents. Indeed our word for ocean stems from the Greek, as they incorrectly believed the ocean to be a giant river called 'okeanos' (or similar). 

So yeah, his bold claim that I had no come back to this is kinda on the level of fractal wrongness. 

His second argument is also directly, word for word copied off of another creationist site. 
Kudos to GuineaPigDan for spotting this. 
http://www.youtube.com/user/GuineaPigDan 

There are no 'revealed' discoveries related to this passage in Leviticus, and with good reason. 
The ritual for cleaning wounds involves chopping up birds and burning them. 
This is also how the Bible describes to cure leprosy. 

Further the passage only states running water, not clean running water. 
Again, bible literalists will read more into it when they want to, and ignore things that are explicitly stated. 

Leviticus, for those who haven't read it is a blood bath of animal sacrifices and burning animal carcasses. Its really messed up stuff that wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie, or in the annals of the mentally disturbed.

Description: So Posterboy for Creationist Stupidity (PCS) has returned, like the prodigal child.

This time he is claiming that:
Newton was a smart man,
Newton believed in Christianity.

And that this some how validates Christianity.

Regrettably Newton also believed in the Philosophers Stone (a magical item that could turn base metals into gold). By the reckoning of PCS this shows that this is a valid idea, or that it 'proves' that smart people can believe in turning base metals into gold.

The power of Newtons ideas of course come from their materialistic application. 
Such ideas have been robustly tested.

Newtons ideas on Christianity are as untested and lacking in application as his ideas on the Philosophers Stone.

Another way to look at it that Netwon did comparable work on his materialistic laws as Christianity. The former have earned him the title of arguably the most influencial man in history, for the latter, noone knows or cares about. Gives you some idea as to the comparative value of religious research versus scientific research.

Anyways, these videos are creative commons. You can do pretty much whatever you want as long as you don't sell them as your own, or claim to own the material (copy, redistribute, broadcast etc).

Title: The Problem with Religion

Description: It really is terribly simple, 
1) models with predictive capability are of utility. 
2) Science is in a class of its own, a process without competitors, when it comes to its ability to form such models. 

So where is the problem? These are observations that not only essentially everyone agrees with, but practically EVERYONE eagerly embraces, most notably in tasting the sweet fruits of science, such as modern civilization. 

However religion, a model with no demonstrable predictive utility, remains prevalent within mankind. 

The bizarre thing is that all these people who engage in religion must realize what a good model looks like as they use them everyday of their life. Convergent models with predictive capability are the good one... the ones they chose to use. Yet still, peculiarly, these folks still embrace religion which is evidently divergent with no demonstrable predictive utility.

Title: Time to quit?
Date: 2011-01-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ut8XsEDyyzo
Description: Gotta be honest I do kinda enjoy making youtube videos.... and evidently people like watching them. 

Only problem is though it takes up a lot of time. Most of the videos I put out have far more thought, planning and production in them than the 'entertainingly angry man rants at camera about opinions' type thing. 

Initially all I wanted to do was put out some reasonably well thought out media on the basis that eventually people would find it and put it to good use. The channel on average now pulls in some 12 mn hits per year. I figure its worth keeping up.... For the time that's put into it... I reckon it does a lot of good. But increasingly it feels like an unappreciated venture getting swamped in a sea of media... and the only way to avoid sinking is to create more and better material (a treadmill just to keep the head above water). For me this has been heading to a crunch for some time now, probably about a year. Even as it stands this channel significantly impacts on my job, and that really does limit my options for putting more time into this. 

-Is it possible that this channel could produce a living wage? Not a rich mans living wage you understand, something along a teacher's salary. Well having seen all sorts of people go down this route before, it seems they pick up chump change... a few thousand bucks. Teachers salary is about 40-50k a year. Turns out the advertising currently on the channel brings in about 10% of this, but this is mostly due to 'science and education for the win' is neither sexy, nor something that's good for selling stuff. From a personal - career point of view of course even entertaining youtube as a 'job' is suicidal. I have a perfectly respectable and stable future.... who in their right mind would trade that in for the chump change and volatility of youtube? -- truth is though that youtube offers the potential to influence the future on civilization... and in that sense the risk of an individual is maybe an acceptable gambling token.... but Im not about to do anything stupid or suicidal like not testing the ground before making such a bold move. 

So this is mostly about testing the waters, to gauge what sort of support this channel could garner. 

My personal reckoning is that this is unlikely to go anywhere, and that only modest support, maybe 10% of a teachers salary will be brought in. In that event, I'll just blow the cash on making some entertaining science media..... a few thousand bux can give quite a lot of latitude in disposable resources to someone who has a reasonable idea of what they are doing. 

But we shall see....the dice are rolling.... and the outcome is uncertain....

Title: Which telescope to buy?
Date: 2010-12-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sAzhOSbxMiI
Description: Below are some of the telescopes I've used in recent years, ranging from ~30 -3000 dollars. (shortened for YTs character limits) 

Price $35 
76mm reflector dobsonian mounted (Celestron Firstscope) 
Weight ~ 1kg (a couple of pounds) 
Setup time ~0 
East of Transport 1 
Short focal length- wide angle field of view. Finder not really necessary. 
Ultra cheap, good views of Moon, Jupiter Venus, rings of Saturn, bright, wide separation double stars, and brighter deep sky objects such as M13. I was not particularly impressed with the optics on mine, but for 35 bucks, you cant complain too much! 

Price $200 
90mm Maksutov-Cassegrain, dobsonian mount (Orion Apex) 
Weight ~ 1kg (a couple of pounds) 
Setup time ~0 
East of Transport 1 
Longer focal length means smaller field of view for comparable eye pieces. I was impressed with this scope on the planets. It vastly outperforms the Firstscope on optics. The scope comes off the dobsonian mount on a quick release and can be mounted as a spotter scope (the main reason I got it). The dobsonian mount here (one arm) is exactly the same as the mount for the Firstscope. These are sort of the poor mans refractor. Great views of Moon and all the bright planets. Picked out Titan (brightest moon of saturn) with ease. I got this telescope for two reasons, firstly for outreach, in that you can just grab it and point it in seconds, zero setup time. Secondly I can mount it piggyback on the CPC11 (see below) and use it as a spotting/ guide scope. 
The Maksutov has the 'nice' feature that its a closed tube(helps keep dust out). The Mak. will have the edge on planets/ guidescope etc due to its longer focal length, but the Newtonian will be more all around bang for the buck. 

Price $600 
10in Newtonian reflector, dobsonian mount (Celestron Starhopper) 
Weight ~ 15kg (~30lbs) 
Setup time ~10 mins to carry parts outside, 10 mins + cool down. 
East of Transport: Telescope is about the size of a small child (although not that heavy). It is big and awkward. Difficult to handle for the small. Almost the biggest telescope you can fit in a compact car (the reason I got it). 
The long open optical train requires periodic alignment (columniation) if it is frequently transported. Powerful deep-sky scope. Near zero photographic potential, but fantastic views of nebula, globular clusters and galaxies. Great scope for planets too. At this size the moon is getting too bright to look at for any length of time. Like most big newtonians, short focal ratio, which pragmatically means you get quite wide angle views. Again well suited to deep sky observing. 

Price $1500 
90mm (3.5in) Stellarvue apochromat, -no mount, tube only (Apo Triplet) 
Weight ~ 4kg (~8lbs) 
East of Transport: The telescope is small and easy to transport. Comes with a bag that will go on an airplane as hand baggage. 
Worth the price for the aperture? Probably not unless you are in a fairly specific niche. 
This makes a great wide angle lenses for guided photography. As a guidescope its focal length is kind of short. That basically means the field of view for a given eye piece is wide. You need a very short focal length eye piece to get good magnification. I found myself using a 4mm eyepiece to look at planets, and even at that the image was small. As a finder scope though, that wide field is great. The other thing that these scope gives is absolutely beautiful stellar images. The stars just fall into incredible pin pricks. 
Beautiful contrasty flat views. I found the use of the short focal length eyepieces annoying for planetary use. Lacks the light gathering for versatility as a deep sky instrument. I only really ever used this as a piggybacker for the CPC11 below. 

Price $2800 
11in Schmidt Cassegrain, driven goto alt-az fork mount (CPC11) 
Weight ~ 30kg (~65lbs) and thats just the top section. Tripods another 15 kg I think. 
Setup time ~30 mins to carry parts outside and align, 20 mins + cool down. 
East of Transport: It will fit in a compact car. To carry the telescope any distance really isnt an option unless you are strong. The ergonomic design is very good though. I always found mounting up the scope a bit of a bitch. Aligning it is relatively easy as the scope mount has a GPS in it that means you dont have to plug in these numbers and the time. Alignment is quite easy. I found the scope slips relatively easily unless the clutches are done up very tight. The scope can carry quite a burden (although of course when the scope weights this much extra, it does need to be well balanced). At this level it is an excellent photographic platform. It yields amazing views of almost everything. It's photographic potential is probably as good as you can get from a portable platform. 
This is the instrument I used to do the full rotation of Jupiter, although there the primary limitation was the stability of the sky.

Title: Did NASA really find New Alien Life??

Description: NASA announced 'An Astrobiological finding that will impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial life'

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/12/01/science.1197258

An astrobiological finding? Really? not just an interesting study of some extremophile bacteria in Mono Lake?

While the results and the research are both interesting, the oversell in unjustified based on it.

Specifically speculating about arsenate based DNA based on....... well not a lot really. Some EXAFS that shows little more beyond the model sensitive stuff kicks in that its tetracoordinate. Now they claim they can tell the difference between that and the AsO4 anion and its variants, but EXAFS is really pretty model dependent stuff for anything beyond the first shell.
They also do some phenol-chloroform analysis and some other fairly standard biochemistry, all based on the assumption, which is a very shakey one, that IF they have arsenic DNA, then it will behave in a similar fashion to regular DNA.
The irony is this woman, Felisa Wolfe-Simon, claims in the press conference to have read all the seminal paper etc etc including Watsons n Cricks paper on the structure of DNA, leading to the bloody obvious Q. why not just do the fiber diffraction patter, then QED. I mean IF they have what they say, its a crystallographers wet dream with all those heavy atom substitutions!

A lot of the oversimplistic view of biochemistry really rubbed me up the wrong way. Getting overly worked up about which chemicals are present and which ones are not seems kinda trivial. The work in itself is interesting enough without this sort of claim, the more so as this facile overview of biochemistry is only much use for noobs.
I mean if this trivial stamp collecting is what NASAs into, you can substitute Se for S in many proteins, and indeed the crystallographers love this sort of heavy atom substitution.... should we call a press conference of astrobiology for this too? Similarly for various ion substitutions. 

Loads of the technical detail of the paper bugged me too, the way they always refer to phosphate and arsenate explicitly as the 3- ions, even when they are incorporated into molecular structures. They classification of the phosphate and arsenate species present also represented significant biochemistry thinking. Looks like most the basisity of the solution comes from the carbonate, but some sort of estimate of the various concentrations of the various protonation states of the oxyanion in these solutions would have been nice (relatively trivial to calculate). Basically saying what you gurgled into these solutions is not as useful as what exists in the solutions you used.

Finally I have grave doubts about the premature nature of this data, and couldnt help but feel the shadow of Pons and Fleischman. Big PR announcements that turn out to be bogus just undermine the publics confidence in science, when civilization needs it as never before.

I sincerely hope Felisa is right here, for all our sakes. If I was asked what my estimate of an organism being able to absorb this sort of structural shock in a few generation going from an entirely phosphate based backbone to arsenate (given that this will mostly likely have BIG effects in both histone binding, and transcription, the factors that determine the production of proteins) I would be giving it a chance (generously) in the few percent range. Biochemistry is REALLY picky over structure.

Title: Free Your Mind!
Date: 2010-11-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rhPJHfR3Pco
Description: It is easy to get seduced by the world you see ever day of your life. The Sun rises, and Sets, and many are not even aware of a similar motion of the stars, or the march of the moon around the sky. Yet all it takes is to open the minds eye and translate one frame of reference into another and you get so much more of a fantastical view of things. The pulse of the solar system, as it spins within our galaxy, within the Milky Way. 

Maybe one of the funkier ways to do this is to get a telescope to track the stars all night long, then realize that the telescope is not really moving, well in orientation at any rate, and that all you are really looking at is the Earth spinning in the foreground. 

To make things even more fun you can look across to our nearest gas giant neighbor, the mighty Jupiter, one of the brightest objects in the sky! Even the smallest of telescopes will show you its moons, and reveal Jupiter as a disk: indeed even a modern camcorder (2010) on ~60x zoom will show the moons of Jupiter! Modest telescopes, 3-6 in (75-150mm) will reveal structure on Jupiters cloud tops and show the shadows of the transiting moons. Jupiter rotates quickly, about once every 8 hrs, which in principal means its possible to watch an entire rotation of the planet over a single evening. 

In this case I used a CPC11, a fairly sophisticated telescope (~3000 bucks), I forget the eyepiece, but a tele-extender and a 2 year old HD camera (vixia HF10 ~$300 now). Turns out this setup was far from ideal, but it was kinda thrown together in middle of nowhere. Problem was to get the right magnification, the image was too bright (newer camcorder have better brightness ranges, but I didnt have the right adaptor to mount a newer camcorder), so I had to put a lunar filter in the optical train, and then correct the color in editing. After that take about 10 seconds of video, and import it into a program called Registax, a wavelet based, quasi-adaptive optics based image enhancement program. Its free, and the developers deserve a lot of kudos for their efforts on this. 

http://www.astronomie.be/registax/index.html 

For the record, the nights seeing was not particularly good, as is evident from the high cloud that comes in later on the timelapse, and so the results here are well below optimal, however I was traveling at the time and had limited windows of opportunity, and it takes a night of work to do something like this. Really I should have done this from a dark and stable site, but there just wasn't the opportunity. 

And now comes the point where you can really put it all together, a nights observing, and the telescope tracking Jupiter, then make a timelapse of both Jupiter and the telescope tracking it, and superimpose one on the other, and you have a whole rotation of Jupiter, as seen from the terrestrial merry-go-round. Further I really lucked out here, with both Io giving a show of a transit, at the same time the Great Red Spot arced around the planet! 

Cute thing is that with 4 telescopes at good observing sites around the world, a little automation, and you could get 6 months continuous footage like this each year. Further a telescope in a higher earth orbit, or out in the LaGrange points could basically relay continuous footage like this.... however thats really a project for someone with real funding :-) 
(or maybe a project for next year!) 

Also used to make this video, Celestia, and GoogleEarth. 
Both fantastic and free visualization software.

Description: The National Center for Science Education ( http://ncse.com ) is instrumental in keeping pseudo-science out of the class room. This is the sort of action that will lead to a more scientifically literate US, that can make better decisions and more efficiently compete on the global stage. 

Historically this has been mostly about keeping religion such as creationism out of the science classroom, however more recently this has expanded to include things like climate change, and stem cell research. 

While folks like Aronra, Andromedaswake, CDK007, C0nc0rdance, Donexodus2, DPRJones, greenman3610, and myself (Thunderf00t) among others do a good job of exposing this pseudo-science here on youtube, and folks like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens etc do a good job of promoting free thought on the public stage, NCSE arguably plays a more pivotal role in the long game. After all folks like us could do this stuff indefinitely (essentially treating symptoms), however the cure is to stop filling kids heads with pseudo science when they are young. This is also not just a matter for Americans either, for even now, America is the prime exporter of creation ideas. Put simply supporting the NCSE is like lending your neighbor a fire hose when his house is on fire!

Title: Why Do People Laugh at Creationists (Part 34)
Date: 2010-11-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=A8SizmM-_5M
Description: So Nephilimfree had an interesting week. He elected to not turn up to try and defend his assertion that nozzle size would have an effect on the height of the jet, and so as promised (an intimate part of his lunar bukake theory), so he is now the star of a second 'why do people laugh at creationists' episode, WDPLAC pt34 

Nephilimfree really does go so far off the comically funny deep-end that its difficult to keep it focused. All good fun nonetheless! 

He seems to now think that Noahs flood, flooded the Earth, caused the craters on the moon, AND the comets, and also deposited the iridium in the 'K2' boundary as he calls it. 

Now of the obvious objections to this, 
1) there isnt enough energy to do it. 
2) even if there were, the energies would kill all life on earth whether they were in a boat, or arc, or not. 
3) Comets dont bear any resemblance to terrestrial water 
a) notably the cyanide level in comets would be nearly instantly fatal to humans (fatal dose ~50mg). 
b) comets are about 10% CO. That means that merely enough water to cover the earth with 1m of water would give about a 1% partial pressure of CO in the atmosphere. This would be enough to make everything lose consciousness and die in minutes... apart from of course some of the insects who don't rely on hemoglobin for oxygen transport. 
4) Nephilimfree claims that that KT iridium comes from Noahs flood. Well surely this means all the non-avian dinosaurs died before 'the flood' and all the mammals after? 
5) comets are mostly volatiles, as is bloody obvious from their average density of about 0.6g/ml (about half that of water). Bodies that melted during accretion have depleted stony material, and enhanced iridium in their mostly iron/ nickel cores. Chondrite meteors never fully melted, and do not show this phase separation behavior, and so still have high iridium contents versus the depleted iridium crust of the earth. It is currently thought that a chondrite meteors was responsible for the KT event. 

And no Nephy doesnt dream up these fun ideas himself, well actually he does add some pretty funny stuff to it, but its all part of Walt Browns 'hydroplate theory' (quotes obviously as this is not a theory). Ironically Nephilimfree thinks that evolutionist scientists are desperately trying to disprove this 'theory'.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTiz4rWZB6M 

and is evidently proud of such a video getting 'honors' to the level of broadcasting them to his subscribers. 

In this video he suggests a discussion on blogtv. 

We have decided to do this on Sat. 23rd Oct 2010 at 3pm EST on the thunderf00t blogtv channel. 

http://www.blogtv.com/People/thunderf00t 

I will record it, and host it on the thunderf00t youtube channel shortly afterwards. 

On recent stuff, I dont really see calling dawahfilms on his BS as drama, but I guess you just have a somewhat different view of such things when someone is specifically hunting you down in real life with the intention of trying to screw you over. 

Addressing the 'vocal critics'. Okay guilty. 

and of course coughlan.... well that guy deserved it. I mean arguing with a troll is a pointless activity, and I enjoyed giving him a taste of his own medicine.

-certainly his behavior on youtube is consistent with it. 

When he failed to get the attention he desired from praising me, he did the bipolar inversion and tried to get it by spitting at me. 

He has also gathered around him a bunch of 'thunderf00t critics/haters'. 
The prime ones being physicalconservative, scousecaspa, and shredderisalive. 

After everyone else had recognized dawahfilms for what he was, for some reason all of these were still advocating dawahfilms position in some way or another. 

Looked to me more like 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend', and so it was that these folk aggregated around the Doc hunting muslim who thinks his religion gives him a mandate to kill under certain circumstance. 

Anyway, having had enough of this, I invited ALL critics to a blogtv session where I gave priority to the harshest critics. 

About a thousand people turned up, enough to constitute a representative sample. 
It went on for about 6 hours. 
There were some thoughtful criticisms, but the majority from this hard core critics were universally panned. 

I will host the ones that people recorded shortly (blogtv said it was recording but recorded nothing) such that you can judge for youself how the chiefs of these detractors, like shredderisalive handled things.

Description: Dear YouTube, recently a privacy complaint has been made against this video. I would encourage you to review this video. You will find that I made no mention of DawahFilms real name or city of residence nor any other personal information was revealed. I do use a few clips of his video, videos that he himself uploaded to YouTube. Part of the privacy removal process states that I am not allowed to disclose any information that has not been publically made available by DawahFilms himself. He put his own face on YouTube, I am merely responding to things he has said and done towards me. 
Also at the same time I received this privacy notice, I got 4 other videos flagged down which I do not seem to be able to appeal. In some cases these videos were very vanilla (see The Best Emotional Porn). I think one of your moderators may have put his fundamentalist religious values before youtubes policies.

Osama bin Laden- Shot in Head! (news/ documentary commentary on current affairs)



Yup, would you believe it, not only does Dawahfilms thing that he speaks for 'all true muslims' and who they have a mandate to kill, but also thinks that if anyone should have the gall to call him on his BS he has every right to do whatever he sees fit to get his vengeance.

Naturally, it would never have passed his mind that he was getting flak because he was talking crap. Nope it MUST be that everyone was prejudiced against him.

The only possible cause of action.
1) take it up with youtube. Youtube of course ignored him, as given that he had thrust himself into the forum to criticize others, it really did seem like he had implicitly agreed that that was the nature of the forum, and that he had no right to bitch about others criticizing him.

2) Take legal action. Unfortunately I had done nothing wrong as doubltess he would have been informed, and evidently so as nothing was taken forward.

-Now most people would be getting the message at this point, that 'maybe you are just acting like an irrational little crybaby jerk', but not Dawah 'I speak for all true muslims' films. Nope he goes Doc Hunting

Yeah, seems that those who presume to speak for all muslims also think that they have the right to hunt people down in real life with the stated intent of getting me fired, and that it would 'ALL BE MY OWN FAULT WHEN IT DID HAPPEN'.

I remember this sort of logic from the IRA when I was a kid. It wasnt their fault for blowing people up in England, it was all our fault for allowing British oppression.

The irony of course being that he specifically and publicly accuses me of reporting him the the FBI. Something that is of course demonstrably false.

But evidently justice from someone who 'speaks for all true muslims' is a VERY one way street. Yup, its only when people say stuff he doesnt like that you have the right to hold them publicly accountable at their jobs. But for Dawahfilms, he gets to shoot his mouth off about everyone else, for instance directly comparing all and sundry to the 'extremists'.

So yeah, no sooner was I thinking of drifting off to do something more important, waddya know, Dawahfilms is slap bang in the middle of the radar again.


Oh yeah... and for those who have an interest, this is the video where he chastises me for not being specific enough in catagorizing muslims, then goes onto speak for 'all true muslims', the video where he repeatedly directly compares me to the extremists, and of course threatens to send me to the god i wished i knew for some contrived fantasy.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRvHeMCLmk
and yeah, at the time of posting this (Oct 6th 2010) he had long since disabled comments, after all, nothing says I can take criticism better than disabling comments!

Right, and the guy who blew the whistle on him, dixiecomic
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I_SFUGC89Q

Turns out, Dawahfilms isnt at all bitter about being shown to be such a nasty piece of work and recently replied to one of dixies comments:
''DawahFilms

Description: I have to admit I was kind of baffled by the response to my latest video, in that the lions share of the critical comments were against things that were not said in the original video, and in some cases explicitly not said. 

Ultimately it has to be my responsibility. For people have associative minds, and so if you put enough keywords in a given message, people will categorize your message accordingly, even if it was not something that was actually said. However for those who actually took the time to parse the video, they will in fact find none of the actually messages that a significant portion of people seem to have decided were there. I should have been more careful of my use of language. It's the old axim, publish in haste, repent at leisure, but alas I other significant calls on my time other than making youtube videos. 

Anyways, so I just took a random sampling of early responses, that largely mirror the text comments, and highlight the point that what they think I said, and what I actually said are different in critical factors. In an intentional form it would be called 'strawmanning' but it can be done unintentionally too. 
You know its amazing how the choice of a single word can change things so much, from, 
'I like some flowers' and 'I like all flowers' 
-Its a minor misquote to be sure, but it's nonetheless one that is explicitly not there, and it is unfair to criticize someone who said the former on the basis that they said the latter. 

The same was also almost universally true of the 'Draw Mohammad Day' videos, where a very common criticism was that I did not make enough distinction between different brands of Muslims, where in virtually all cases the distinction was explicitly made.

With Islam, this is almost comical, in that if a similar attack had been performed on an icon of the Muslim faith (as the WTC was arguably an icon of the US), say for instance 'Christian Infidels' flying civilian planes into the Kaaba, that at this point, almost a decade on that Mecca would be ready to have Christians building churches near 'Ground Zero' given that even as it stands Mecca strictly prohibits ALL non-muslims from entering the city. 

Looked at like that I have only one reply. 
I will not be lectured on the virtues of tolerance, or accept bargaining chips labeled 'in the name of tolerance' from someone who, in order to comply with their religion get down on their knees 5 times a day and pray to a icon of discrimination.

Title: Creating Hell in a Pop Bottle
Date: 2010-08-23

Description: Hydrogen Oxygen has an adiabatic flame temperature of about 3000 degrees kelvin, thats about half the temperature of the surface of the Sun. Question is... just for fun, can you put that into a pop bottle! 

Previously I've shown other fuel air burns, one similar to that used in most internal combustion engines (butane air), and the other as one of the more common rocket fuels (hydrogen oxygen). Both release lots of energy when they burn, which is of course what makes them suitable as fuels. 

The hydrogen oxygen burn though is particularly fascinating as it only produces water as an 'exhaust', further it produces very little water! Indeed to fill a bottle with hydrogen and oxygen you only need to turn about 0.5g of water into H2 and O2, and of course when you burn it you only recreate that half gram of water. 

To make life even more interesting, to actually do the electrolysis I use a 12 volt Li-ion polymer battery, very similar to those used in most laptops today, simply so folk can visualise in a very simple way the energy content in these everyday objects. Indeed the energy content is significantly higher as only a fraction of the energy I draw from this battery actually goes into creating the H2 and O2, while probably the majority goes into heating up the electrolysis solution. 


Now when H2 and O2 burn, there is actually a reduction in the number of molecules of gas, which would, if all other conditions were the same actually produce a reduction in pressure, however the temperature of the exhaust gas is not the same, it goes from about 300K to 3000K which in a confined system would increase the pressure from about 1 to 10 atmospheres. This is getting close to the failure threshold of these bottles, and also represents a significant rate of release of energy.- caution is required, and this really isn't something you should be trying unless you really know what you are doing.

Title: Nukes to stop oil leak:- Biblical Prophecy!

Description: For the League of Reason show Sunday 18th July 2010 (edited for length and coherence)

Christian caller Thickshades decrees that if you read the Bible 'properly' and with 'wisdom' it is possible to predict the future. He his then asked to use his skill and wisdom in reading the Bible to predict the future with hilariously funny results. Turns out he thinks that in the first instance that the Bible specifically predicts that nukes will be used to seal the oil in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. When he is pushed on this topic by andromedaswake he then kinda has a change of heart and announces that the Bible can't predict crap.

Naturally we invite Thickshades back to clarify exactly how he got from the Bible to nukes in the Gulf of Mexico to seal an oil leak in 2010.

Title: 2nd and 3rd Brightest Objects in the Sky meet!
Date: 2010-07-15

Description: Venus, Mars and Saturn all visible in the early evening sky. 
The Moon will be right under to Venus on the 14th, 
Right under Mars on the 15th and 
Past Saturn on the 16th by which time it will be approaching the first quater. 

Look to the West, shortly after sunset and you will firstly see Venus, the Saturn and Mars will appear somewhat fainter and apparently further from the Sun. 

Over the next month or two, you can keep track of the ballet of these planets in the evening sky. Venus will rise up past Saturn and Mars, before all three planets sink into the twighlight glow. What is really happening of course is Venus is undertaking us on an inside orbit, while we are burning off both Saturn and Mars on the outside orbits. 

Anyways its a great time to not only identify these planets but to get a feel for their movement too. 

As for if you actually want to take a look at these things. 3in (~80mm) is probably the smallest scope you will want to consider. That will show you the rings of Saturn, and the phases of Venus over the next few months. Mars is v. small at the moment, and I couldnt really even resolve it as a disk, but at its closest it will show some detail on Mars. It will gives spectacular views of the Moon, and will show the moons of Jupiter and detail on Jupiter. 

The cheapest I could find a scope like this is the 'Firstscope'. Celestron made them for the '2009 year of astronomy' and I think there is a surplus, cos the are now selling them on amazon for about $35. 

This time I actually get the scope on the moon, and it gives some pretty good views. I also get it on Saturn. Just pointing the camera in the eyepiece is okay, but its not as good as what you see. After I have 'wavelet' processed the video using a free program called Registax (a sort of primitive adaptive optics... lucky frame stuff) it gives something that is actually pretty close to what you will see. Rings of Saturn are almost edge on at the moment, and it's not at its best. When the rings are fully open, Saturn is always a show stopping, jaw dropping sight. Anyways, it gives you an idea of what you will be able to see with one of these 'Firstscope' things, a 76mm Newtonian reflector. 
http://www.astronomie.be/registax/ 

Bigger scopes will show you more, but to be honest you will need to learn how to use a scope first, and something like this celestron Firstscope thing will give you this feel.

Title: The 'Miracle Man' and his God versus Science
Date: 2010-07-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=km1ZeMBiWwU
Description: Nephilimfree persists in making virtually all the claims of Jesus..... that is the claims of a schizophrenic. And yup... he really should be kept away from loaded fire arms and segregated from society, for both his own, and everyone elses safety... well at least until he gets his condition addressed. Indeed this doubtless would be the fate of Jesus if he was transported forward in time 2000 years and into a civilization that has an understanding of mental illness. 

So anyway, Nephilimfree made the claim that he was here to 'prove god on youtube' at 'Gods' behest... great so he can no longer make that claim that 'god will not demonstrate himself'. Anyways he then went on from his demonstrably wrong claims about how 'water in the Earth' at the beginning of 'Noahs flood' could have caused the craters on the Moon to making an equally scientifically illiterate claim that nozzle size would be a factor in determining the nozzle velocity. 

This really does highlight the problem with those who get their scientific insight from the same place they get their miracle healing powers.

Title: God to redefine Physics in 5 days?
Date: 2010-06-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=DmyofFeILtg
Description: Despite repeatedly claiming to be right, and to have 'God' on his side, thus far Nephilimfree has shown a remarkable reluctance to demonstrate this. 

Initially he deleted from public view every video he had on the subject of Noahs flood causing the craters on the Moon:- a strange way to defend what 'god' had told him. 

He was invited to the League of Reason to defend his claim. He declined. 

He then left some comments on another creationist video suggesting the nozzle size would solve everything. 

Now Nephilimfree has repeatedly claimed to be an agent of 'God', and that 'God' personally called him to youtube to make videos to 'prove god with science'. 

So surely with 'God' on his side, wanting Nephy to 'prove him' one is left with only one question.... what bizarrely surreal excuse will Nephs paranoid psyche come out with to rationalize his inability to do even simple physics problems. 

As for those mere mortals out there who don't have 'God' to solve all their physics problems and want to know how you do it.... well Im afraid you are going to have to wait till the weekend! :-)

Both Nephilimfree and Shockofgod have managed to get themselves on the front page of Conservapedia multiple times, and in this sense have qualified themselves as Why Do People Laugh at Creationists material. 

In many respects we should thank Donexodus2 for stirring up things with his recent 'attempted' debate with Nephilimfree. 

Nephilimfree is without a doubt a pioneer of creationist science. He is the avant garde of new creationist thought. Indeed as far as I know, he is the only 'creationist scientist' to be putting new ideas on the table, and shamelessly pimping them as 'Gods truth'. Well that would of course be great if Nephilimfree was not comically scientifically illiterate. 
So many time when I watch his videos do I get flash backs of dealing with Venomfangx, and cannot but help feel that after half a dozen videos Nephilim will get the message that every time he says 'science proves', he is in reality doing nothing but prostituting his ignorance. 

In this case Nephilimfree seems to have latched onto the single fact that the LCROSS NASA mission found water on the moon. 

His creationist mind goes through all the possibilities.... 'Noahs flood had water..... therefore the water on the Moon came from Noahs flood'.... and that would of course be great if that was all we knew. Unfortunately for Nephilimfree, he makes the fatal creationist error that he actually puts some numbers on his model, enough numbers for anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of physics to be able to laugh at him without fear of reprisal. 

All you need to know is 
Potential energy = mass x g x height 
(where g is the 'gravitational constant'.... its actually a function, but near the surface of the Earth it actually makes a pretty good approximation to a constant.) 

and you can comfortably hand him his ass. 

Creationists essentially never come up with new ideas, and in this respect Nephilimfree is almost unique... that is at least he is trying. Unfortunately he his batshit insane and scientifically illiterate. 

The greater shame is that I had a chat with a guy by the name of 'Truthfulchristian' who cites Nephilimfree as one of his 'scientific sources'. Yeah I know, reach for your preferred metaphor, -the blind leading the blind, or in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king...... 

At any rate, Nephilimfree has now not only achieved some level of 'efame' with his little anticlimactic drama moment with Donexodus2, but has repeatedly found favor with Conservapedia:- his efame has now reached the dubious honor of being feature in the WDPLAC series. 

If Nephilimfree feels the need to defend his 'Noahs flood is why there are craters on the Moon' hypothesis, next weekend, we will be having another LeagueofReason call in show on blogTV.

Previously 12 cartoons had resulted in cartoons that prompted embassy burnings, death threats and murders, all of which had a significant chilling effect on the free press of the West. 

Now, after Draw Mohammad Day, there are over 12000 cartoons, and the Islamic world has been shown to be essentially toothless. The best that they could do was shut down parts of the Internet for Pakistan (a country where it is still possible to get executed for blasphemy). A short sighted mover as they cannot expect to integrate into the modern world without embracing the internet. 

That was it.... they were shown to be powerless on the internet.... there were no embassies to burn, no product they could refuse to buy. They were confronted with the proposition that Sharia Law does not apply on the internet, and that if they try to enforce it, or threaten to kill people, they will get served. 

Through Draw Mohammad Day, the wake up call of the internet age has been heard in the Islamic world, and once they have accepted that they do not get to dictate the rules to the rest of the world, and have accepted free speech.... then there is the possibility for rational discussion. 

The victory was won by those who acted, and in spite of those who tried to undermine it.

Back in 2005 the Muslim world went off the deep end over half a dozen cartoons. 

The rampaging mobs had a distinct chilling effect on free speech. 

However since then there has been a growing dissent at the abysmal precedent this sets in self censoring yourself simply because some psychos issue a few death threats. 

This recently came to a head with the South Park incident where again some Muslims tried the same old game of issuing death threats. This time however it wasn't going to happen. This time people had had enough. Draw Muhammad (Mohammad?) day was born. 

To do my part to support this I did my best to defiantly show that if they wanted to take away my free speech it was going to take more than death threats. 

Yet no backlash came. The youtube videos chalked up the best part of a million hits.... and no backlash. The facebook site gains some 40k members, who have already some 2000 images on the draw mohammad site, and still no angry mobs. 

Yeah its clear what the score is here. Death threats are only played when they think they can get away with it. Of all the cheap opportunistic cowards. 

Well fine... the original schedule goes ahead. 
20th May 2010.... The first Annual Draw Muhammad Day. 

The bottom line is that if Islam cannot learn to coexist with free speech, then it cannot coexist with the West.

Draw Muhammad Day on Facebook at: 
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-Draw-Mohammed-Day/121369914543425 

I was kinda disappointed by just how few people understood 'the sleeping giant' reference. 

It of course referred to the rather prophetic quote from the IJN Fleet commander, Admiral Yamamoto after the annihilation of the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. 

War is always a bloody business, and Yamamoto understood two key factors, firstly the 'character' of the US, and how when sufficiently incited they could be terrible and single minded, and secondly, that once the US industrial might had been fully mobilized it would be unstoppable. 

Yamamoto second rather prophetic statement after the bombing of Pearl Harbor was 'I can run wild for 6 months, after that I hold no real hopes of victories'. 6 months after came the decisive (although to be fair a large element of the outcome was down to luck) Battle of Midway which crippled the lions share of the IJN naval air power. 

Three years later Japans cities were getting systematically raised to the ground, culminating of course in the double nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.... but that's a different story. 

Many of those without the historical background to understand this filled in the meaning of the quote as they saw fit. Those with axes to grind 'gleefully rejoiced' and declared that 'thunderf00t supports and advocates genocide'. 
They didn't stop there though, many went on to show how 'Thunderf00t is exactly the same as the extremists' with such specious reasoning as 'thunderf00t zealously advocates something, and so do the terrorists, so they are the same'. 

I also didn't make it clear in the earlier shorter videos the difference between a dispassionate appraisal of history and an extrapolation of likely events based on historical precedent and current military dispositions and Dawahfilms fantasizing about how his religion, gives him the right.... no demands that he kills certain people. 

For the benefit of those who didn't spot the difference, a rational and strategic assessment of a problem is not the same as publicly fantasizing about how a magic book gives you the right, AND REQUIRES that you kill people.

Just because some blood thirsty mob has been inspired by some primitive and savage desert myth is not a good reason to roll over and surrender one of the oldest and most valued treasures of Western Civilization. It is however a good reason why that religion has no place in the civilized world. 

How many other religions incite blood thirsty mobs over cartoons? 

How many other religions have angry mobs chanting for the blood of countries, or the bombing of civilians? 

In the mean time these jerks need to be shown that their attempts at intimidation are not only a failure, but that as they sewed the wind, so shall they reap the whirlwind...

Any organization that states that it has the supreme authority to kill someone for voicing an opinion has no place in Western Civilization. 

I can think of no organization that has fielded more psychotic nutters like this than Islam. It appears to be the one thing that the religion excels at. 

I always found it funny just how sensitive Islam was to criticism. 

-Too bad fellas... this is the West, and this is a public forum where people can say what they want. For instance here I show how your god 'Allah' and his Prophet, and every Muslim joined in prayer on the planet is still no where near as powerful as my little finger.

(note currently (1st May) the original video has not returned. If it doesn't come back in the next day or so (as Viacom said it would), we'll have to do it the old fashioned way). 

On Sunday 25th Apr 2010 I put up the video South Park vs Islam. 

Less than 24 hrs later the video had the best part of 100k hits, and Viacom issued a DMCA take down notice, even though the video only contained 10 seconds of South Park footage with no audio. 

When it became clear that Viacom had not only filed the DMCA notice, but that it was not an automated take down (else all the mirrors would have been taken down too), but someone at Viacom had actually made the decision to file this DMCA -copyright take down notice (the evasion of their lawyers I talked to spoke volumes!)..... to say that I was angry is an understatement. 

I had gone out of my way to do what South Park and Viacom did not have the back bone to do. To call bullshit on those who think that a few death threats will humble free speech in the West.... and then having invited these small time religious losers to do their worst, I got stabbed in the back by Viacom. Yeah pissed really doesn't cover it. Of all the cowardly self-centered parasites... it's difficult to know who is worse, those who want to try to limit free speech by a few death threats, or those who would sell out free speech simply as they think to do otherwise might damage their profit margins.

So the US-based Muslim website Revolutionmuslim.com posted a barely concealed veiled threat against the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone for depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a bear costume. 

Well kudos to the South Park creators for showing the backbone to defiantly stand against those who hope, through threats of violence, to have a chilling effect on free speech. 

I see no reason to mince words here. Theo van Gogh was killed for nothing other than making a film critical of Islam. He was shot, stabbed and beheaded in the capital of a First World country. Over a hundred were killed world wide in riots etc over the Danish cartoons. 
-It is unacceptable, unthinkable, that we should stand by and allow such folk to import the core of their religion, -the core which has kept their civilization in the dark ages for the last 800 years into our enlightened civilization. Not while I have my strength. I have seen the fruits of the Enlightenment, and I have seen the stagnation of the Middle East. 
We cannot allow them to do this as firstly they do not have the maturity to wield the power of the Age of Reason, and secondly who in their right might would wish to re-embrace the Dark Ages. 

Sharia Law is an irrelevance in the first world, and if you think that if someone draws a picture of your 'Prophet' that this means you have the right to kill them, then you have no place in the First World.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=65KIexy4New
Description: A comparison of the fuel-air flame speeds in butane/air and hydrogen air mixtures. 

The mixtures in each case are near stoichiometry. 

Hydocarbons-air mixtures are typically what cars run on, just with octane-air rather than butane air. You can run rockets on liquid hydrocarbons/liquid oxygen, indeed the heavy lift section of the saturn V rocket ran on liquids oxygen (LOX) and kerosene (a moderately long chain hydrocarbon). While per unit volume of gasious combustion this actually produces more energy than the hydrogen-air mixture, the nature of that energy (spread over more molecules, with a lower temperature) means that its not a good a propellant as hydrogen-air. 

Hydrogen-air mixture have ferocious combustion speeds, over a vast composition range. As the energy of the reaction goes almost exclusively into the water molecules produces (which are very steam), it makes an excellent rocket propellant. Naturally most of the gas in these bottles is the nitrogen that makes up 4/5 of our atmosphere. If it were simply a H2/O2 mixture the explosion would be about 2-3x as big. Rockets run on liquidized fuel. As a rule of thumb, there is about a 1000 fold increase in density on liquefaction. 
This is the mixture the shuttle uses, and it uses some 4000 liters of it per second! 
That's the equivalent of burning some 4 million of these bottles per second!

For those who want to know the camera is Exilim EX-FC100 which does 1000 frames per second slow motion video (about 1/30th speed). Can't tell you much more about it that it seems to work okay, and like all digital cameras it gets great reviews:- the reason I can't tell you much about it is that I made this video the same day I got the camera.... just wanted something interesting to try it out on! :-)

Title: Of Catholicism and Capone
Date: 2010-04-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0BpmeX6lwZc
Description: There can be little doubt that had any other organization other than the Catholic church that was trusted with the care of children, for instance an orphanage, a school, or a daycare center, had been found to not only been abusing the children, but to swear the victims to secrecy, and then to move the molester to another center... there simply would be no debate about allowing the organization to conduct its own investigation and to impose its own 'punishments' of repentance. Both the individuals and the organization would be up on criminal charges before you could say knife. 
However for the Catholic Church, law enforcement seems powerless. The church simply says child molestation is evil, and that through true repentance can come renewal, or some equally nebulous BS, and the church gets away with such criminal acts- scot free! 

However even if institutionalized child molestation doesn't take the church down, it has been a huge blow to it's credibility. In that sense it's kind of like Al Capone being taken down for tax evasion. Especially given that the Pope has stated that he thinks that condoms actually increase the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa!

Title: Was God a Volcano?
Date: 2010-03-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XtI-lSvS028
Description: If you actually read how Moses (the important guy who god spoke face to face with, and the guy who got the 10 commandments off of God) describes 'God' in the bible, it's basically the exact description of a volcano. 

Seeing as Moses is held to be a prophet in all three of the big monotheistic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism), is it possible that the 'God' of all three of these religions was actually nothing more than a volcano? 

Is it not more likely that a bunch of desert nomads come witness a volcano, and seeing as they have never seen one before they think its 'God'. One of their number is crazy enough to go up onto the volcano, where he sees all sorts of volcanic stuff that he mis-interprets as god, and seeing as he's obviously a bit crazy anyways (y'know, how many sane people would go up onto an erupting volcano?) he has a bunch of 'revelations from God' on the mountain. When he gets down, not only does this impress the hell out of the nomads, but he tells them that he spoke to 'God' in the fire and smoke. 

Moses (and co.) describing 'God' as a volcano: 
Exodus 13:21 
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 

Exodus 14:24 
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 

Exodus 19:16 
And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. 

Exodus 19:18 
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 

Exodus 20:18 
And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 

Exodus 24:18 
And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights 

Deut. 4:11 
And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. 

Deut. 5:4 
The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the middle of the fire,

Title: Is Islam a hate crime?
Date: 2010-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Xi34wL4KIfo
Description: If the line is not drawn and defended, then you will lose the battle of free speech inch by inch. 

This work is in defense of the video by zomgitscriss where all she basically said was 'if the big bang and evolution are in the Koran, as many Muslims state, then why weren't these discoveries made by Muslims 1400 years ago!' 

This video got taken down for 'community guideline violations' within a few hours of her putting it up, presumably by criticism-hypochondriac-Muslims who interpret any dissenting voice as 'hate-speech'. 

DPRjones then mirrored this video and also had the video removed for 'community guidelines violations' within hours. 

Well if this is the way youtube is going to run the forum, then it has little further value as a forum for discussion. The line is drawn. 

Youtube makes it's call to either stand by values of free speech that make it an asset to the western world, or it yields to the 'anything bad said about Islam is a hate-crime' lobby. 

In either event, I did my part.

'the end of the world cult' 
Fascinating documentary about some guy who claimed to be jesus (one of many) and predicted the end of the world a couple of times. The interesting conclusion (other than the world not ending of course) was that he was arrested for his sexual abuse of minors. Seeing the 'son of god' go from righteous 'they are persecuting me like they did with jesus' to a man institutionalized in prison, on hunger strike is a fascinating insight into the human mind and the messiah complex.

Title: An open reply from 'an educator'
Date: 2010-03-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kIj8PXOe9Cc
Description: Many didn't like the kinda pissy tone of the original video (although notably also many thought the bitchslap was well deserved!). Well yes, but I really just see that as a fairly predictable response when pogobat, aka Dan Brown just put out a video to some 200k subscriber basically pissing on, and badmouthing university education. 

To paraphrase: 
'It was getting in the way of my education' 
'just about learning lots of facts' 

-How would you have expected me to respond? 

Well anyway, this is the response after taking a deep breath and counting to ten... well actually a lot more than 10!. 

Dan seems to have changed his tone somewhat. Apparently he's offended that I insulted his parents(?)... yup I was like WTF too... apparently he couldn't tell the difference between 'get a parrot' and 'get a parent' (hearing fail?). 

He also seems to have 'fled the field' so to speak in that his reply basically entailed his stating that he only wanted to 'stimulate debate' (troll?). Well fine, if he wanted to badmouth education, then say that he didn't really mean any of it, he just wanted to stimulate debate, fine, but don't claim that you're not like Glenn Beck afterward! 

If you want to put forward ideas on the open forum, either have the guts to stand by them Dan, or to admit your wrong. Pissing on the university education system, then tucking your tail between your legs and running off when someone tells you that you are talking crap is unlikely to impress anyone, let alone when your justification for 'fleeing the field' mostly revolves around 'but you called me and my parrot names'. To me this looks like you are just looking for face saving excuses, but then again, thats exactly how I read your 'I dropped out of school' video too.

Title: RE: An Open Letter to Educators
Date: 2010-03-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Aikjdi3psUE
Description: pogobat aka 'Dan Brown' is one of those yammer at the camera type guys... very entertaining I'm sure, but when he blows smoke trying to justify why him dropping out of school was 'a good thing as it was interfering with his education', and that really it wasn't his fault, it was that the university lecturers didn't know his name (lmao), and didn't organize his social calendar for him, and they expected him to learn stuff EVEN THOUGH THE INTERNETS EXISTS.... its time to call bullshit on the bullshit artist. Especially seeing as his 'dropping out is good AND NOT MY FAULT' message seems to have resonated with his seemingly young and impressionable audience. 
-This video was put together in haste as a form of reducing the damage caused by pogobat. 

Yeah I know the guy is vain (the guy really included the key word 'handsome' in his description of his video about education!), egotistical, subscriber whore/BS artist, and I have little doubt that part of what was going through his mind while doing this was to create some drama by bad mouthing education and showing what a rebel he is by proudly dropping out. 

Great for him I'm sure.... but shite for society... and the future of society. 

I only addressed the core of his arguments here (mostly the strawman about university education ONLY being about learning facts), a lot of the rest of what he says is bs too (google being a wonderful company...lol tell china that!), and how the value of information is going down. Education is more important now than ever, and to operate in a technologically advanced civilization you need to know somewhat of how it functions. The guy with the 'right information' and right ability to implement that information is more valuable than ever.

Title: Evolution for IDiots (remix)
Date: 2010-02-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=x5YhE3a5dqw
Description: While going through the old vids, getting together the why do people laugh at creationists series (WDPLAC) I came across the 'lost' material of an evolutionary algorithm (writing out code to the free ray tracer, POV). 

The video I always thought was under-rated, so I figured I would re-rub it with better titles and in wide-screen. 

Incidentally, evolutionary algorithm (EAs) are among the easiest to write, and its fascinating to look at the detail in these simulation in that you can see genetic drift on 'unimportant' (non-critical/non selected genes). From memory (it's been a few years) the 'bugs' were defined by about 50 genes, I cant remember if reproduction was sexual or not. Indeed it's frequently the case that its hard to see the selected genes, although they obviously have to be there. Further of course the real differences are only visible over multiple generations. 

EAs are maybe the simplest way to demonstrate that evolution is an logical consequence of the intrinsic properties of life. If you have imperfect replication in an environment where there is attrition, evolution is inevitable.

Title: The Bible for beginners (Part 3)
Date: 2010-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OqMoGfNtVy4
Description: About 1/3rd of the people on this planet call themselves Christians, although peculiarly only about 1 in 10 have ever read the Bible. Personally I think this number is hopelessly optimistic with maybe only 1in 100 to 1000 having ever really read the Bible. Yup so about 90 % of Christians believe in something they've never read about. In order to partially remedy this, I'm starting a new series called 'The Bible for Beginners' where I will read highlights from the Bible to see if Christians actually subscribe to the Holy book they have never read, or not. 

In this episode we look at the central character in Christianity, the figure of Jesus Christ. He mostly crops up in two places in the Bible, in the Gospels and in the Revelation of JC. However when he does turn up in Revelation he is not exactly wearing his 'Prince of Peace' hat... indeed he threatens to make some woman sick, then to kill her children (yup, Jesus Christ, child killer, Revelation 2:23... way to stay classy!). Not content with just threatening to make people sick and to kill their children JC then goes on to say he will give his minions a rod of iron to smash up everyone else. If this character were in any other book, he would fall squarely into the clinically psychotic category! 

This is then compared to JC in the Gospels (Luke 19:26), where he commands everyone who disagrees with him to be bought before him and killed. He then goes on to instruct his disciples to go and steal a horse for him. Nice role model!

Title: The Bible for beginners (Part 2)

Description: 1 in 3 of on this planet identify themselves as Christians, yet very few (ca 10%) have ever read the Bible. 

The Bible for Beginners tackles this problem. 

There are some 30 000 denominations of Christians, and hence of course when someone claims to be a Biblical scholar you must ask them which of the mutually exclusive denominational interpretations they are a scholar in. 

However the idea behind the Bible for Beginners is to tackle broad subjects that are applicable to all Christians (e.g believing in Christ, God etc). 

In this episode we take a look at Heaven, the place where most Christians believe they will go when they die. Its actually described in the bible in Revelations, and it's a jolly weird place too is the heaven described in the Bible!

Why Do People Laugh at Creationists, Part 32.
Kent Hovind and his retard offspring Eric Hovind push 'four questions', and attempt to contrast how science views the question with how their particular sect does. The underling sentiment is 'it more pleasant to believe ours, therefore its more likely to be true'. Needless to say, its more pleasing, and the questions are better answered if you assume you are 'God'. Just because it makes you happy, doesn't make it true.
Anyway, the obvious follow on to this is what does science say about mankind, and how does this compare to anything obtained from any of the bronze age religious texts. 

As you can guess, the religious insight into the shape of mankind is a joke.

As always, open source for educational purposes, enjoy! :-)

Title: 50 % Never go to Church!
Date: 2010-01-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_o07FvWTAVw
Description: Yes, within this study in upstate NY, 50 % never went to church, although apparently some 85%+ were Christian(!). 

The five questions that were asked: 
1) Sex 
2) Age 
3) Are you worried about the future 
4) How often do you go to Church 
5) Is your personal relationship with God more important than going to Church 

In each case I asked people 
'Would you be interested in answering five, brief, anonymous questions' 
... if they agreed... 
'if you don't feel comfortable answering the questions, or they don't apply, please, just leave them blank'. Overwhelming everyone answered all the questions. 

The interesting thing was, of those who were skeptical, the majority thought that I was 'selling religion'. 

Initially I wanted some 200+ data points (for a 5x5 grid that gets you ~10 points per bin), however I only got just over 100. However because nature of the patterns observed, thats enough for this pilot study. 

After that it was simply a matter of correlating the data. 

Key points were: 
1) 50% + of people (both men and women) never go to church. 
2) men and women have almost identical church going habits 
3) men are more likely to be worried about the future, and are more likely to think that communal religious activity is more important than a personal relationship with 'God' than women. 
4) While the stats were really too low, there is the suggestion that those who go to Church once a week have a more diverse attitude to how they feel about the future than people who never go to Church. Those who never go to church are typically only 'slightly worried' about the future. 

Yup I realise the limitations of such a study. However bear in mind that pervasive human behaviors, such as the Milgram and Barnam effect can be observed on very small populations, maybe as few as 10! The goal of this study was to scout around for similar effects. 

Naturally it would be great to get this study done in some more volatile environments, and to try to correlate this sort of thing world wide, but before that, a little careful reflection is probably required. ;-)

Title: Why Religion?
Date: 2010-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nuWCsJm0zcw
Description: I see no reason for the social taboo of not examining religion, the origin of religion, and the role it plays in societies. 

To this end, I did what any curious mind would do... I took a brief look at the circumstantial evidence, put forward a testable proposition, and set forward to test it. Quite a lot of donkey work in this sort of thing, but seeing as religion is a pervasive human behavior, it is my hope that relatively small sample sizes will give a general and representative feel for the role of religion in societies.

Title: How DMCA abuse could affect YOU!
Date: 2010-01-10

Description: There is a loophole in the DMCA that can affect who is a regular poster on youtube. 

The digital millenium copyright act is designed to protect mostly 'big' intellectual property. 

However this act can be abused to obtain personal details, which can then be used in a malevolent fashion. 

We need to close this loop hole such that the DMCA does not protect 'big' intellectual property at the cost of our privacy.

Description: I got quite a lot of msgs saying they liked the stuff in the lab, so I figured I would see if another such vid. got a similar reception. 

While passing through the UK I did some work in a lab involving liquid nitrogen. The stuff is dirt cheap and an invaluable tool of science, however its also fascinating stuff to play with and there is always some left at the end of the day :-) . Naturally there are some hazards to handling liquid nitrogen, but to be honest, there are larger hazards from fueling your car yknow pumping 10+ gallons of highly flammable liquid into a, typically plastic fuel tank. 

Anyways some cheap yuks with liquid nitrogen enjoy! ;-)

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists (part 31)
Date: 2009-11-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yqB4FOlCtls
Description: Okays, looks like Banana Man has decided to fill the shoes of PCS. Fine by me.

Ray Comfort, of Way of the Master (Living Waters Ministry) is a fundamentalist Christian, best known for declaring that bananas prove the existence of God.

Now Ray always tries to put the positive spin on this, like look at all the publicity I get, while ignoring the fact that he is an internet star only for his stupidity. 

However, while Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron may be slow learners, its dawning even on them, that having someone who is famous for their stupidity endorsing a product like the bible, may not really be a particularly good strategy. 

They have therefore evidently tried to rewrite history at least twice now to shake off the spectre of The Banana man. The first one was the apology from Ray Comfort, where he basically said his banana design proves god is valid, if you include the coke can. In this video he also acknowledges that bananas have been selectively cultivated by man (he uses the word hybridize). Ray, in a recent video has back pedaled on this to saying there is no evidence of this. Yes this is simply denial. However denial should not be too much of a surprise given the mans claims that he KNOWS where the universe came from, because of some 2000 yr old desert ramblings. Anyway Ray Comfort has now gone on to pretend that even his attempts to rewrite history never happened, and in what can only be described as a bold faced lie, without shame, Ray has now claimed that it was satire/ humor all along. If you had said that from the beginning Ray, someone might have believed you. Regrettably the fact that your story changes every time you tell it simply rings of a liar without shame trying to shake off a brand image, that on camera you claim to be happy about.

Yup this video is not as polished as some of the more recent WDPLAC.
It was made in comparative haste, and on the road. I have real work to be getting on with at the moment, and free time is a scare commodity.

Many thanks to Linda for supplying the transcript for this video!

Title: Creationist Cowards Diss Darwin
Date: 2009-11-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zapJeJZvyAg
Description: So Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron of The way of the Master have again chosen to let their actions speak to the worth of character that their religion instills. In their latest publicity stunt they have decided to take a book written 150 years ago by Charles Darwin and put in the front a 50 page introduction, a significant portion of which is devoted to bad mouthing the dead. 

Yup thats right, apparently dissing the dead is now fair game if you are a creationist. 

Unfortunately they havent realized that this is utterly independent of whether evolution is correct or not. The only take home message just how cheap creationists are willing to go to attack science they dont understand. 

To my mind there is only one appropriate response, and thats to basically call them on their socially reprehensible behavior:- maybe we need a modified bible to explain simple decency and logic to such folk. 

So far, Ray, Kirk, Ken Ham n co have shown a masterly reluctance to present a scientific case, and claim that this is due to some persecution. Well okays fellas, you are formally invited to present your case on one of the more open and public forums of our time. Here on youtube. 

I had to put this video together on the road, and in some haste, so please forgive the sound, and some of the production shortcomings.

Not even the Daily Show, or The Colbert Report can expect to plagiarize the best selling book of all time, and expect to wait for the best part of a year before someone calls you on your BS! Especially with a ever-watching, divine, omni-remembering, omnipresent, and omni-humorous being in the arena. 

On more serious note, not only is this a skit on the similarity between Stephen Colberts (of Comedy Central, of Viacom) interview with Congressman Lynn Westmoreland (who after espousing the virtues of the ten commandments) can only name three of them, and the bit in the Bible (in all the gospels) where Jesus can only name 5 commandments. The real funny bit is its different in all the gospels, and Jesus names commandments that are not found in the old testament. Further the commandments that Jesus can name are the ones related to social behavior, and have little to do with religion. For instance you may thought Jesus (if he really were God) would have named, thou shalt have no Gods before me as important, but not a bit of it! 
The second role this video performs is inspired by Liberalviewer, whose channel moto is fight for fair use. 
Indeed both he and I share a common bond in that we have both successfully contested DMCAs filed by the multi-million dollar company Viacom.

Description: On the road again.... work.... 

Came across some cesium in a lab, and decided to share. 

Regrettably, what everyone usually wants to see with cesium is for you to throw it into water for the explosion. However explosions in the lab are usually seen as 'undesirable', especially if its somebody else's lab, and somebody else's cesium. 

Spot of glass blowing and metling cesium, the most reactive of the stable metals, with 'ones bare hands'!

Title: Youtube vs free speech
Date: 2009-10-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cebsoBbXpv8
Description: Some time ago I instigated an action against youtube by releasing the videos called 
Youtube versus the Users Part 1, 2 and 3. 

The videos all got 10s of thousands of hits and were mirrored by those who supported the cause hundreds of times. 

Now if you type the exact title into the youtube search engine, I get nothing at all. I have talked to people all over the world and this is about what 50 % of the people find. 

This is a pretty Orwellian re-write of history, and there is only one appropriate action that anyone who desires to protect free speech could engage in, and thats to call bullshit on youtube. 

However this pattern is something that is of wider concern. 

Youtube has effectively a monopoly on the user based video market. The fact that they are willing to manipulate that system to their advantage opens essentially establishes this as a source of corruption waiting to emerge. Some form of oversight is required. 

As users, one mechanism by which you can apply pressure on youtube is by videos such as this. In essence keeping youtube on its toes by ensuring that they realize that there are many vigilant eyes on them, who will cause a public relations disaster for them if they are willing to bastardize the fair and level playing field for their financial gain. 

I think it very likely that youtubes beta channels also border on market abuse. 

They have taken a user base that was built up on essentially viral dendritic navigation and morphed it into something that looks very much like a commercial video distribution network. Now thats not so bad in itself, but to say that it was done for the users benefit is of course bullshit- dont spit on my cupcake and tell me its frosting!. Similarly actions like these simply do not gel well with corporate slogans like dont be evil. Indeed, if anything this fills me with concern over the lack of accountability and power of organization such as google. 

To a very large degree, if google wipes anything you create from its search engines, then that information effectively cannot be found, and effectively doesnt exist anymore. 

The information age is here. To an extent we already live in 1984. Someone has to control the search engines, and the access to data. However to have corporate monopolies with little or no accountability is clearly a very dangerous path to tread.

Title: One Video EVERY Christian should watch!
Date: 2009-10-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5ODeI1u-0bg
Description: Almost no Christians have read the Bible, an interesting irony given that it is purported to be the source of their religion. 

When you do read the Bible, its like entering a mad house. The books of Moses are a bloodbath from beginning to end. The God of Moses appears to be a volcano, and worships in an orgy of blood and dismembered animals. 

Then you get on to Jesus, and things really dont improve much. Jesus states that all the old laws about burning witches etc, given to Moses by God still stand, and Jesus spends most of his time healing the sick, casting out demons and preaching. The irony being that even after he gives his disciples magic powers to cast out demons, many of them still doubt that he is the son of God. 

Anyway, this video just cuts out one short segment of the Bible, about witches, wizards and demons. All form part of the narrative of Jesus and God in the Bible. Remove these, and you rip out the credibility of the book on its big claims about Gods, and Sons of Gods and you reduce the Bible to merely a story book. 

It is my reckoning that people can identify Harry Potter as a work of fiction. Why then should people struggle so much in identifying the Bible as a work of fiction?

Title: The Biggest Bang that No one ever heard.

Description: LCROSS (Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite) is about to hit the moon. The exact time of the impact (give or take a few seconds) is Friday 9th Oct 2009 11:31:30 UTC (about 7.30 EDT). 

Its going to hit at about 9000km/hr (~2.5km/s), and with a mass of about 2 tons that will give it about the same energy as a ton of TNT. Its not quite the biggest extra-terrestrial manmade silent bangs ever. Deep Impact which hit comet Temple had a considerably smaller impactor (~400kg) but went MUCH faster (MV^2 counts!). Deep Impact hit the comet at about 10 km/s and had the same energy as about 5 tons of TNT. 

The weather of late has been lousy in upstate NY, but if its clear, I will try to record the impact.

Title: Swine Flu Update, Oct 2009
Date: 2009-10-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-9kMkJeia1o
Description: There swine flu has been sweeping through one of our local university campuses. There have been about 700 reported cases, and one fatality. 

As I too was having flu-like symptoms I thought this would be a reasonable time to revisit the topic of the swine flu pandemic. 

The real problem is there is so much of the virus now out in the population. Mutations are expected, and its unclear in what direction they will take the flu. 

While the chances of someone dying from the current swine flu are on the order of 1 in 3000 (thats assuming that a pandemic typically infects 1 person in 3 and that one person in a thousand who gets the virus will die- ball park figures) that still put the expected death toll for the US alone at about 100 000. Thats about 30 times the death toll of 9/11. 

However the amazing thing is that it looks like the flu shots conspiracies videos outnumber those with any academic credibility by about 10 to 1. In this sense I will be focusing on geerup (that the new venomfangx) for the subject of why do people laugh at creationists part 31.

Title: Fox News shows murder and blames it on the godless
Date: 2009-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cMwZ76QB7uk
Description: So Glenn Beck on Fox News recently (September 29, 2009) showed a graphic murder. This is the sort of thing that would get a video pulled from youtube almost immediately, but for some reason Fox deemed it important enough to put on the Glenn Beck show. 

Now I've seen the ugly side of mankind. But to be honest this is something that one has to mentally prepare for. It should not be the sort of thing that should get pushed in your face. I mean the only warning Beck gives is to tell 'children to leave the room' before showing the young teen getting beaten to death. This is I am pretty sure just for the shock value to make the audience more receptive to Beck telling them that its all because we have taken in god we trust off some of our currency. 

Beck goes on to blame this on the 'loss of god' in America. 

Beck gives several monologues as tirades where he basically dictates to the audience what they should think, and in this sense is not unlike howtheworldworks. 
Watching Glenn in action is like watching the art of manipulation in motions. He targets his appeals to every mechanism of suggestions, bar reason, logic and facts. 

If I sound a little off or if the language is a little off. Bear with me on this one Im currently laid up with the swine flu.

Mooja is interesting as not only is the join date within one day of deadzebramonkey, but also after the whistle was blown came alive having not left any signs of life for the last 18 months and added favorites and featured videos (in line with the suspected protagonists views) and comments in the suspected protagonists demeanor. 

These are just a few examples. Blank, largely dormant accounts do not all converge on one lesser known channel, and all subscribe to the same 5 channels in a narrow window. People just dont behave like this. 


-Someone is gaming the videos. 

Even the IP logs will not really help here as a 3rd party is almost certainly involved. (accounts spreading years all coming alive to favorite the same 5 videos (and only them) then return to dormancy). 

Circumstantial evidence is the best that is available. 

It may well have been that such activity was initiated by a third party. However some of the sock accounts (noteably mooja12) then came alive having done nothing for 18 months and added favorites in line with these channels, and defended them by ridicule, using the word genius (a mannerism of howtheworldworks). 

It is known that Lee Doren (howtheworldworks) has strong links with all these accounts. 
It is known that Lee Doren (howtheworldworks) is the Crasher in Chief of an organization that uses internet marketing. 
It is known that Lee Doren (howtheworldworks) is, to put it mildly, a subscriber whore. 

These facts essentially provide means and motivation. 

It should also be born in mind that: 
Lee Doren (howtheworldworks) made an attack video suggesting that the guy who initially uncovered this (cristoballs) take down his video (which he claimed was defaming him) or he would take further action to clear his name. An interesting course of action given the clear pattern noted above. 
On the whistle being blown, Policytranslated hid their subscriber list. One cant but help feel the easiest way to scotch such rumor if true would have been to have left them open. I know I would have. There are only about 500, and the account is essentially inactive.

Title: Howtheworldworks Vs Free Speech
Date: 2009-09-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4JHwZXQ8Hv4
Description: Howtheworldworks thew a tantrum when I favorited a video critical of him, demanding that I unfavorite the video, and youtube remove the video. The irony being that for the large part all HTWW does is spread vitriolic disinformation about others. Anyway, it was clear he was just trolling around for some attention, so I did what was required and ignored him. 

However he then added the annotation to his video demanding I unfavorite this video that 'Thunderf00t took down the video'. 

This would be like putting up a video demanding the sun to set, then adding the annotation that the sun later set. 

At this point I deemed this as not only an attempt to rewrite history, but also as an attack on the credibility of the Thunderf00t channel to stand up to those who would limit free speech. 

These are the reasons for me making this video. 

The gauntlet is throw down to Lee such that he can either show that he was not bluffing, or admit that he was a coward trying to limit the free speech of others by bullying and threats.

Description: Jupiter rotates once every 8 or so hours, and some of its moons hammer round too! 

The Earth rotates every 24 hrs, and its possible to get 8+ hrs of darkness. 

It is possible, under favorable conditions (now (Summer 2009) is not a bad time) to see an entire rotation of Jupiter in one night! 

This is a time lapse of me trying to get a timelapse of an entire rotation of Jupiter. 

Few people realize just how visible the planets are, with Jupiter appearing as a bright star. Similarly Mercury, Venus, Mars and Saturn are all easily visible to the naked eye. Indeed the angular size of Venus (at its largest) and Jupiter is such that they are only just not visible as disks with the naked eye. 

This video hopefully not only shows how accessible things like Jupiter are in even modest instruments (almost everything will show Jupiter as a banded disk, and the four main moons), but also links the timescales on which things happen on Earth to whats happening (the planet spinning and the moons orbiting) on Jupiter.

By the looks of things, 
DPRJones, Themaskedanalyst, FSAthe1st, mikefoz and DMCAabuse all got hit (all are missing their channel icons in my favorites)

For those who want a chuckle, I had actually turned the car around to head down to San Bruno (YT HQ) to knock on their door and see if they anything to say.

Title: So Dramaqueen (PCS) wants a 'debate'

(Night on a Knife-edge (to be uploaded shortly)) 


So PCS wants a debate, or more specifically another debate. 

The first (at least my half) is still on my channel as debating a creationist parts 1-3. 

PCS deleted all of his. 

The last one has a request for a vote for who won. 

It came in something like 97% for Tfoot, 3% for PCS. 

However I think PCS does sterling work in representing Creationism and Intelligent Design and would be only too happy for him to throw his cap back into the arena. 

He wants another debate thats fine. I will happily do it for his return. However PCS does not have a good track record in keeping his word. As a token of faith I have requested that he makes 5 videos before we have this debate. 

Now Im sure he will cry that but what about the safety of my family. Well what indeed PCS? Firstly you are the one who challenged me. Secondly how many seminal debates in history required permission slips from ones parents? And lastly you have cried wolf on this so many times its not funny anymore. This time last year (when I was touring) you pulled EXACTLY the same stunt. Why not take a more mature response to such matter like factversusreligion and just post the screen names of those who issue death threats, laugh at their immaturity and get on with life. After all, are there ANY cases of threats on youtube leading anywhere? 
http://www.youtube.com/user/factvsreligion 

I dont even care about death threats, let alone the even more sadistic threats you make that my god wont just kill you, he will torture you for eternity 

Lastly, if you really had any commitment to your message then what would you care for this life when your eternal salvation is on the line? 

So yeah, bollocks crybaby. I will debate you if you come back youtube. 

Bring back the clown!

Journal entry 22nd July 2009. (relevant bit, whole entry is too long for rest see beautyintheuniverse) 
Up with dawnpeckish so found mcdonalds for breakfast. Back to Rays place where I had about 4 hrs to kill before our meeting at 11ish. Started adding placemarkers to the bible at the interesting bits I had found. By the time I had finished there was a lot of blue post it notes sticking out the bible. It has now also become clear to me that while my preferred modus opperandi has been in the defense of science, I have now read enough of the bible that I could utterly shred this shepherds myth. Its an interesting question should I set all the time I have spent going through the bible in detail to naught and just let Christianity have its peace, or should I actively engage in its demise. When the ministry opened at 9ish I went and introduced myself, and they gave me a rather officious line about not doing anything till the appointed time. No big deal for me, I put some effort into ordering the car and mending some bust electronics (resoldering wires etc). Stuff that had been put on the back burner for expediency on the road, but a more ordered man would have taken care of he went along. Saw Ray arrive by car, which raised an eyebrow as the 60 minutes thing said he cycled to work. Probably just he didnt want to cycle if he was going to be on camera. As a cyclist myself something I could empathize with. Ray is a small man, but chirpy and polite. Surprisingly Ray now informed me that there was no problem in me filming. Hmmm wtf?, but my only care at the time was the original deal was being honored. Shortly after he invited me in it was a little intro and pretty much straight down to business. The consequence of which was I only had a few minutes to brief him on points I wanted to raise. A point which I was keen on doing as I wanted the point I was making to survive robust scrutiny, and not to survive simply as they were bought up in real time (catching someone on the hop). The moments that raised an eyebrow for me was how quickly ray picked up on me lying to him, as an example of how religions are created an propagated. (by mechanism of the almighty Tod!) I am a poor liar. Its amazing though, how well even folk like ray can pick up on the bodylanguage. On watching the video you can see it all. How he gets uncomfortable and starts shuffling. I cant remember too much of the details (it was too much of a manic day) but I do remember seeing Ray being troubled by some of the points I was making. I could see the doubt of a man challenged with a concept altogether new to him. I could see it in his bodylanguage of his eyes. After that we went to lunch ray was buying. We took the camera man too who is obviously a hovind fan. Systematically I went through his points one by one and in the most mild of demeanors academically shredded them. The shame being that noone else at the table, other than myself would have been able to assess the academic veracity of my arguments. Ray offered to help me out by putting me up in a motel for a night (after a fashion). The offer was sincere and I think somewhat precipitated by rays sympathy for what he perceived as my hardship. I graciously thanked him for the offer but turned it down in that I like rough life in the wide open space. After lunch ray gave me a tour of the ministry. The place clearly oozes with money. Rays artifacts are very coy (a skeleton for the cupboard etc) He also has a collection of fake hominids not something to inspire someone with confidence about ones academic footing. 
Then had a long chat with the camera man about the history of the earth (using the correlated history of earth poster). One by one I cut down the hovind arguments, and eventually all he had left was to simply say there are both sides of the argument. 
Its amazing testament to the feedback mechanisms of the mind, that even after the foundations of his belief had been systematically and academically removed till none remained that he was still sure that there was two sides to the argument. Then had another chat with ray, which I wish I had recorded.. mostly about the bible. The things I really remember was that Ray believes in witches, wizards, demons and sorcerers. Hmmm thats usually a end of conversation type moment. He also thinks that the holocaust was gods way of punishing the jews. I told him very clearly that that was not going to make him very popular if he voiced such opinions in public. 
Ray left and I spent an hour talking with his graphic design man. He clearly wasnt greatly interested in talking about points of contest, and we got on very well. He was a model maker and pilot. We talked teccie for an hour or so. A good guy!

It has now also become clear to me that while my preferred modus opperandi has been in the defense of science, I have now read enough of the bible that I could utterly shred this shepherds myth. Its an interesting question should I set all the time I have spent going through the bible in detail to naught and just let Christianity have its peace, or should I actively engage in its demise. When the ministry opened at 9ish I went and introduced myself, and they gave me a rather officious line about not doing anything till the appointed time. No big deal for me, I put some effort into ordering the car and mending some bust electronics (resoldering wires etc). Stuff that had been put on the back burner for expediency on the road, but a more ordered man would have taken care of he went along. Saw Ray arrive by car, which raised an eyebrow as the 60 minutes thing said he cycled to work. Probably just he didnt want to cycle if he was going to be on camera. As a cyclist myself something I could empathize with. Ray is a small man, but chirpy and polite. Surprisingly Ray now informed me that there was no problem in me filming. Hmmm wtf?, but my only care at the time was the original deal was being honored. Shortly after he invited me in it was a little intro and pretty much straight down to business. The consequence of which was I only had a few minutes to brief him on points I wanted to raise. A point which I was keen on doing as I wanted the point I was making to survive robust scrutiny, and not to survive simply as they were bought up in real time (catching someone on the hop). The moments that raised an eyebrow for me was how quickly ray picked up on me lying to him, as an example of how religions are created an propagated. (by mechanism of the almighty Tod!) I am a poor liar. Its amazing though, how well even folk like ray can pick up on the bodylanguage. On watching the video you can see it all. How he gets uncomfortable and starts shuffling. I cant remember too much of the details (it was too much of a manic day) but I do remember seeing Ray being troubled by some of the points I was making. I could see the doubt of a man challenged with a concept altogether new to him. I could see it in his bodylanguage of his eyes. After that we went to lunch ray was buying. We took the camera man too who is obviously a hovind fan. Systematically I went through his points one by one and in the most mild of demeanors academically shredded them. The shame being that noone else at the table, other than myself would have been able to assess the academic veracity of my arguments. Ray offered to help me out by putting me up in a motel for a night (after a fashion). The offer was sincere and I think somewhat precipitated by rays sympathy for what he perceived as my hardship. I graciously thanked him for the offer but turned it down in that I like rough life in the wide open space. After lunch ray gave me a tour of the ministry. The place clearly oozes with money. Rays artifacts are very coy (a skeleton for the cupboard etc) He also has a collection of fake hominids not something to inspire someone with confidence about ones academic footing. 
Then had a long chat with the camera man about the history of the earth (using the correlated history of earth poster). One by one I cut down the hovind arguments, and eventually all he had left was to simply say there are both sides of the argument. 
Its amazing testament to the feedback mechanisms of the mind, that even after the foundations of his belief had been systematically and academically removed till none remained that he was still sure that there was two sides to the argument. Then had another chat with ray, which I wish I had recorded.. mostly about the bible. The things I really remember was that Ray believes in witches, wizards, demons and sorcerers. Hmmm thats usually a end of conversation type moment. He also thinks that the holocaust was gods way of punishing the jews. I told him very clearly that that was not going to make him very popular if he voiced such opinions in public. 
Ray left and I spent an hour talking with his graphic design man. He clearly wasnt greatly interested in talking about points of contest, and we got on very well. He was a model maker and pilot. We talked teccie for an hour or so. A good guy!

Started adding placemarkers to the bible at the interesting bits I had found. By the time I had finished there was a lot of blue post it notes sticking out the bible. It has now also become clear to me that while my preferred modus opperandi has been in the defense of science, I have now read enough of the bible that I could utterly shred this shepherds myth. Its an interesting question should I set all the time I have spent going through the bible in detail to naught and just let Christianity have its peace, or should I actively engage in its demise. When the ministry opened at 9ish I went and introduced myself, and they gave me a rather officious line about not doing anything till the appointed time. No big deal for me, I put some effort into ordering the car and mending some bust electronics (resoldering wires etc). Stuff that had been put on the back burner for expediency on the road, but a more ordered man would have taken care of he went along. Saw Ray arrive by car, which raised an eyebrow as the 60 minutes thing said he cycled to work. Probably just he didnt want to cycle if he was going to be on camera. As a cyclist myself something I could empathize with. Ray is a small man, but chirpy and polite. Surprisingly Ray now informed me that there was no problem in me filming. Hmmm wtf?, but my only care at the time was the original deal was being honored. Shortly after he invited me in it was a little intro and pretty much straight down to business. The consequence of which was I only had a few minutes to brief him on points I wanted to raise. A point which I was keen on doing as I wanted the point I was making to survive robust scrutiny, and not to survive simply as they were bought up in real time (catching someone on the hop). The moments that raised an eyebrow for me was how quickly ray picked up on me lying to him, as an example of how religions are created an propagated. (by mechanism of the almighty Tod!) I am a poor liar. Its amazing though, how well even folk like ray can pick up on the bodylanguage. On watching the video you can see it all. How he gets uncomfortable and starts shuffling. I cant remember too much of the details (it was too much of a manic day) but I do remember seeing Ray being troubled by some of the points I was making. I could see the doubt of a man challenged with a concept altogether new to him. I could see it in his bodylanguage of his eyes. After that we went to lunch ray was buying. We took the camera man too who is obviously a hovind fan. Systematically I went through his points one by one and in the most mild of demeanors academically shredded them. The shame being that noone else at the table, other than myself would have been able to assess the academic veracity of my arguments. Ray offered to help me out by putting me up in a motel for a night (after a fashion). The offer was sincere and I think somewhat precipitated by rays sympathy for what he perceived as my hardship. I graciously thanked him for the offer but turned it down in that I like rough life in the wide open space. After lunch ray gave me a tour of the ministry. The place clearly oozes with money. Rays artifacts are very coy (a skeleton for the cupboard etc) He also has a collection of fake hominids not something to inspire someone with confidence about ones academic footing. 
Then had a long chat with the camera man about the history of the earth (using the correlated history of earth poster). One by one I cut down the hovind arguments, and eventually all he had left was to simply say there are both sides of the argument. 
Its amazing testament to the feedback mechanisms of the mind, that even after the foundations of his belief had been systematically and academically removed till none remained that he was still sure that there was two sides to the argument. Then had another chat with ray, which I wish I had recorded.. mostly about the bible. The things I really remember was that Ray believes in witches, wizards, demons and sorcerers. Hmmm thats usually a end of conversation type moment. He also thinks that the holocaust was gods way of punishing the jews. I told him very clearly that that was not going to make him very popular if he voiced such opinions in public. 
Ray left and I spent an hour talking with his graphic design man. He clearly wasnt greatly interested in talking about points of contest, and we got on very well. He was a model maker and pilot. We talked teccie for an hour or so. A good guy!

Votebots are back dumping up to 16000 votes on a channel at a time. 

Total votes over the last month this votebot has cast is on the order of 60 THOUSAND. 

I think youtube should appraise the integrity of their voting system. 

In the meantime voting will dilute the effects of these creationist cowards.

Description: So the Discovery Institute have apparently sent one of their attack lemmings to file some false DMCAs to get videos they didnt like taken down. O dear DI someone has just pulled the bonehead maneuver! 
The bizarre thing is the Discovery Institute is essentially manned by lawyers, you would have thought they would have had some aversion to pulling the head in legal blender move.

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists? (part 30)
Date: 2009-05-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VpL1dmfVoGA
Description: Following Casey Luskins flapping on the video Challenging the Discovery Institute to Discover, Luskin has earned himself the honor of being the subject of Why do people laugh at creationists Part 30. 

The Discovery Institute has all but abandoned intelligent design (the rebranding of creationism- see video) as a lost cause, they even go on record saying they dont think it should be taught in schools! 

They initially set up a peer review journal of their own (Progress in Complexity, Information, and Design) but abandoned it after they got called out on the lineage of intelligent design to creationism. 

Luskin helped set up intelligent design and evolution awareness clubs, but stated that the management believed the designer was the God of the Bible, and then happily goes on camera and states that intelligent design has nothing to do with religion, despite all the diagrams he has connecting the two on the IDEA webpage. 

What really astounds me about these guys is they have utterly lost, and yet they dont have the dignity to accept that they were wrong graciously. Instead all you get is a bunch of bitter misfits doing their best to sow disinformation and throw as much mud as possible but for what gain? All I see is a bunch of jerks committing spiteful intellectual vandalism for their personal gratification. Really what do these people hope to gain by pretending there is controversy where none exists?

Title: Challenging the Discovery Institute to Discover: Part 2
Date: 2009-05-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Sq3mKJxxZgg
Description: So our initial video to the Discovery Institute got two replies within the last week. 
The first came by way of the DI fellow William Dembskis blog, uncommon descent 
http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/pz-myers-throws-down-a-gauntlet-to-id/ 

Who actually addressed their response to the well known science blog of PZ Myers of Pharyngula (recommended) 
http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/ 


the second came directly from DI Staff Casey Luskin. 
http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/05/does_any_critic_out_there_unde.html#fn1 
Casey has just earn himself the spotlight in WDPLAC part 30. 

This video deals mostly with the first reply, that deemed that a designer couldnt possibly left signs of a gene with a non-evolutionary origin. Yup thats right, apparently the intelligent designer is only capable of producing genes that are utterly indistinguishable from those produced by evolutionary processes. Hmmm. 

Anyway, the reply then rolls off into a straw-maned quote-mine of a BASIC Evolution vs Creationism textbook- yeah, I know exactly what you are thinking what a peculiar way to defend intelligent design 
Eventually it boils down to the staple of creationism, -same genes, same designer. 
This argument has been hammered many times with things like pseudo genes. What sort of designer makes genes, then switches them off etc etc etc. 
Eventually the quote-mined-straw-man of the creationists gets the only reply that its worthy of.

Title: Votebotted and Suspended!
Date: 2009-05-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=q6OchVQJzag
Description: DPRJones has been suspended and SuperflyNB was hit by 9000 one star votes. 

SuperflyNB had previously done a great job in calling out the votebotter frankgone2010 who youtube swiftly suspended. Frank quickly created a new account as frankreturns. 

Within one week SuperflyNB gets hit by 9000 one star votes and DPRJones gets his video addressing frankreturns taken down for guideline violation. 

This really is beyond the pale youtube. Both SuperflyNB (calling out votebotters) and DPRJones (legal advice for false DMCAs) have been stalwart contributors to the youtube community and to see them get harassed like this is weak.

Title: Challenging the Discovery Institute to Discover
Date: 2009-05-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZkED8cWRu4Q
Description: If people like the Discovery Institute want to put forward hypotheses such as intelligent design as an origin for the information in DNA, then that's fine, but if they want it to be taken seriously, they must provide some evidence to support it. The user C0nc0rdance has provided exactly such a method for them to do this. Its simple, find a gene without an evolutionary heritage. The genomes of about 180 life forms have been sequenced containing maybe a million genes, and thus far the Discovery Institute has shown saintly resistance to look for a single gene that shows signs of non-evolutionary origin. 
If you are an Intelligent Design Proponenist and think this would be an excellent method for presenting evidence to support ID, then arguably your best course of action would be to contact the Discovery Institute (http://www.discovery.org/ ) at info@discovery.org and suggest that the largest pro-intelligent design organisation actually looks for evidence to support their hypothesis. 



The core of this video was made by user C0nc0rdance 
http://www.youtube.com/user/C0nc0rdance 
He makes excellent videos on science and defending science against dis-information. 

Personally I think the Discovery Institute will do their best to ignore this, after all they must have thought of this before, they just do not want to invalidate their hypothesis by trying.

Title: PURE NERD PORN

Description: Well I couldnt make up my mind between Nerd Porn (originally a comment made by Bosco239 on the 'Miracle Water' vid) and The Art of Magic. 

Anyways this was stripping down an Archos Gmini. Always fun to take these things apart and see how the technology is changing. Its also amazing how we essentially live in the Arthur C Clarke world of any sufficiently highly advanced will appear as magic. 

Even the lowest technology bits (things like the sticky tape) are ferociously complex in their constitution (they are a long way from tape with icky stuff on it!). Never stripped one of these tiny hard drives before:- tiny, tiny drive, maybe only a few mm thick stunning. 

I mean really the only reason we dont call this stuff magic is because we live with it every day and know that someone, somewhere must understand it!

Well it looks like the immediate threat of a pandemic has diminished, however there is still a potentially pandemic virus out in the environment. What happens over the next year is largely a role of the dice. 

However there are still actionable items that can minimize this risk to mankind. Some of these are highlighted in this video. 
Such as: 
1)Knowledge of how viruses spread, and how to minimize their transmission. 
2)Preparation for pandemic isolation and control (support for institutions such as the CDC and NHS). 
3)Countering disinformation such as arguments like well the average seasonal flu kills more than the swine flu has so far, so its nothing to worry about or its all an illuminati conspiracy to control you through fear, or well there was a scare a few years ago, and nothing happened, so its safe to do nothing..

Title: Dear Ron Paul, RE: Swine Flu

Ron Paul, Congressman 14th District Texas, recently released a popular video on youtube: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5-Y08qbjo 
which currently has about �ion hits. It is also featured on his official portion of the website of Congress. 
http://www.house.gov/paul/index.shtml 

In this video he scoffs at the Department of Homeland Security having an item about the swine flu and scoffs that since when did the Dept. of Homeland Security get involved in the medical business? 

I deem such comments to be poorly thought out as a very good case can be made for why the DOHS should have swine flu as a number one item. 
It is a phase 5 virus to which humans have no native immunity. It has pandemic potential. Current DOHS measures would be excellent at spreading the virus as it enters the country. 
I have a friend who entered the US on 1st May 2009. No extra hygiene procedures had been adopted at that time.

Title: Swine Flu now in phase 5

Description: For latest on swine flu see: 
http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/ 
(currently in 44 states, 9th May 2009). 

The swine influenza is now in phase 5. That mean the virus has spread to multiple countries and is beyond the possibility of containment. 
It is known the virus is contagious. 
It is know that mankind has not been exposed to this virus before: we have no natural immunity. 
It is known that the virus can be fatal in young people. 

In this video I make some suggestions to what can be done for this. 

Congressman Ron Paul recently said in a popular video that both the government shouldnt get involved in pandemic control as this was essentially a 'healthcare' issue. He also states that the previous swine flu went nowhere. 
I strongly disagree as both 

Both of these arguments have serious flaws. 
Firstly with a pandemic, your chances of you getting the virus depends directly on the healthcare of those around you. Put simply it is a communal matter. 
Secondly just because the last swine flu went noowhere, that doesnt mean they all will. The last big influenza outbreak killed 50 million.

How can I protect myself from getting swine influenza from infected people? 
In the past, human infection with swine influenza was generally mild but is known to have caused severe illness such as pneumonia For the current outbreaks in the United States and Mexico however, the clinical pictures have been different. None of the confirmed cases in the United States have had the severe form of the disease and the patients recovered from illness without requiring medical care. In Mexico, some patients reportedly had the severe form of the disease. 
To protect yourself, practice general preventive measures for influenza: 
•Avoid close contact with people who appear unwell and who have fever and cough. 
•Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly. 
•Practice good health habits including adequate sleep, eating nutritious food, and keeping physically active. 
If there is an ill person at home: 
•Try to provide the ill person a separate section in the house. If this is not possible, keep the patient at least 1 meter in distance from others. 
•Cover mouth and nose when caring for the ill person. Masks can be bought commercially or made using the readily available materials as long as they are disposed of or cleaned properly. 
•Wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly after each contact with the ill person. 
•Try to improve the air flow in the area where the ill person stays. Use doors and windows to take advantage of breezes. 
•Keep the environment clean with readily available household cleaning agents. 
If you are living in a country where swine influenza has caused disease in humans, follow additional advice from national and local health authorities.

Title: Murder / Suicide of Youtuber: Lessons for the community

Description: Youtuber who went under various names, one of which was tony48219 first killed a college girl (Asia McGowan) before killing himself. 

Tonys video were generally disturbingly gregarious, and this was probably a factor in youtube banning him several times. 

Many, including myself, made video critical of Tonys outspoken views. 
Did we do wrong? 
Were we to blame for his death and that of Asia McGowan? 
Are there any lessons that can be learned for the future conduct of the community? 
This video attempts to address some of these issues.

The original video was falsely flagged. 

The video 'they' don't want you to see? 

The similarities between this and dealing with creationists are spooky. 

Description of video: 
Well Howtheworldworks, aka Posterboy for Conspiracy Stupidity (PCS2) evidently now has no problem with uploading in its entirety a video made by someone else and titling the playlist My annihilation of Thunderf00t. 

Add plagiarism to the list PCS2. 

Even more amusing is the fact that The video Thunderf00t does not want you to see suggest that the maker (Misterbusta) ONLY agree with PCS2 on individual rights and not much of what he says. Indeed he starts by saying that this is mostly a response to HTWW(?). 

Misterbusta made a response which he had clearly put some effort into. 
However he seems to misunderstand what an Ad Hominem attack is. Calling PCS a liar is not an ad hominem attack if it put at the end of a long argument showing PCS is a liar. Put simply just because you use a derogatory term does not actually affect the validity of an argument. HTWW (PCS2) does however use ad hominems all the time. There is a clear example in this video, SUBSTITUTING AN ATTACK ON A PERSON FOR AN ARGUMENT. Similarly the end of the first video I did on this (part 1), the ending monologue is left entirely to PCS2 as its just a content-less hominem rant. The lack of factual content in this rant is self evident as I can direct it at him just as easily as he did against someone else. Its just a content-less ad hominem diatribe. 

I'm out of town for the next few weeks, but I will watch with amusement as PCS2 who has adamantly claimed that 'I'm done with Thunderf00t' and 'My subscribers are tired of this crap' scramble to make a response. Sigh, so predictable. 

PCS2 is a gold-mine of stupidity, almost as good as PCS1. The only doubt I have is, is he really this stupid or is he simply pretending to make money a sort of Poes Law for capitalists?

Description: Howtheworldworks is an attention whore, a subscriber whore, and a money grubber. 

This video highlights the fact that his primary concern is making money. You have to ask if he even believes anything he says. When you have seen creationists arguments for several years you get to spot the intentionally misleading ploys. This is somewhat different though, the god squad are after justifying something to make them feel better, howtheworldworks is simply doing it to make money. 

Im pretty convinced howtheworldworks is just a troll out to try to make money out of the right wing sorts. 

PS howtheworldworks Ive now got the lions share of your videos. Its too late to try to delete them. 

Still not sure if this is just the right wing equivalent of a Poes Law. 

You know the deal, pretend to be an outrageously stupid right wing prick, and just clean up on the traffic and attention. Like I said, an attention whore, a subscriber whore, and a money grubber.

Description: The faith over fact brigade are not only annoying, but their dis-information is a hazard to society. Especially money whores like Howtheworldworks whose actions betray the sentiment that there is nothing more to life than money. 

The point that people like this always seem to overlook is the necessity for SOCIETY. 

Howtheworldworks is quite a piece of work. Hes like vernomfangx aka posterboy for creationist stupidty. He can put out enough bullshit in a couple of minutes to take hours to debunk. Similar to PCS he apparently has no morals about stating opinion as fact with absolute conviction. Indeed the only difference between PCS and HTWW seems to be one will make up any bullshit to sustain his belief in god, the other will make up any bullshit in an attempt to make money. Folk like this are disruptive and harmful to the health of society and need to get called on it.

Title: Saturn- March 2009

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fbac3zQgq0g
Description: A look at Saturn through a telescope 2009. The rings of Saturn can be seen in even the most modest of optical instruments. I first saw it when I was about 13 and had just got a 3in toy Newtonian for Christmas. I was just pointing it a bright things in the sky and was stunned to see Saturn, rings and all, sitting there on the velvety black sky like a tiny, but perfect painted gem. 

Saturn is currently (March 2009) due South at about midnight. 

Saturn at the moment is not as impressive as when the rings are open but its always amazing when you see this planet, the more so as you know the Huygens probe now sits on Titan. 

The software used for showing the movement of the planets is called Celestia. Its free and great fun to play with.

Title: Free Speech, Hate Speech, the UN and Youtube
Date: 2009-03-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0aFEBWjJYs0
Description: Hate speech is basically an impossible concept. All you have to do is turn up your sensitivities and then EVERYTHING counts as hate speech. Due to its subjective nature its essentially unworkable. 

Islam is very good at getting offended by almost anything, as is scientology. Both are very heavy on trying to classify people who call them on their psychotic beliefs as hate-mongers. 

Further the recent UN resolution to attempt to criminalize blasphemy is both a step in the wrong direction and is unworkable. 

However when people are using their free speech to advocate the killing of others, they have broken the law. 

But what to do when such a minority constitutes a significant portion of the population? 
Options include education of western values, imprisonment, or segregation. 

Naturally if they can present a convincing argument in an open forum for changing the law, then thats fair enough, but before you have to acknowledge that you are not allowed to threaten anyone who disagrees with you with death or violence. 

Finally youtube. C0ctapus got suspended. He helped out with our recent protest against youtube. Apparently no reason was given. I dont remember too much about his videos other than they were of a similar topic (the problems with religion etc) to this channel. He also was a supporter of free speech.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qrPYQraAcws
Description: Software used to make this video is free, its called Celestia, available www.shatters.net/celestia/ 
Its really worth downloading and having a play with if you want to get to grips in a fantastic fashion with the solar system and universe. 
Its a great piece of software for getting to understand where you are on the planet, in the solar system, and in the galaxy- a very eye opening piece of code. It also allows you to find various planets, moons, and man-made satallites. It is also quasi-research in nature, in that you can actually give the program scripts and make it do some quite sophisticated stuff. 

Since I was a kid Ive been a keen amateur astronomer, and have always marveled at watching the sky move, but in my mind feeling the Earth move. Day and night, the stars and the planets are something we have all seen, but relatively few actually perceive what is going on- a tragedy given that people can live their whole lives in the presence of this knowledge and not see its effects in their daily lives. The spin of the earth, the movement of the planets and why they have their apparent motions etc. This video is an attempt to highlight this perception.

Title: Rejecting Atheism
Date: 2009-03-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w0zSCpsOSSw
Description: You call people by what they accept, not by what they dont. 
In this sense the word atheist is redundant. 

I accept physical evidence and reasoned logic (PEARL), the core of the scientific method. 

It has made our standard of life vastly better. 

It has also delivered us incredible destructive power. In a society like this those who act on faith (without evidence) are an increasing hazard to us all. 

The power that science delivers us must be wielded responsibly, else there will be noone left to discuss the folly. 

Doomsday, end of times Christians like PCS (posterboy for creationist stupidity) lust and desire the end of the world. 

Religion such as this in a society such as ours is simply a recipe for disaster.

Description: Okays, so I had a car with a flat battery. My jump starter died some time back, and all my friends who could have jump started the car were out. 

Now on paper I knew that the little batteries I use to fly the model planes should be able to have a good go at jump starting a car..but the ultimate test is always does it work in practice. 

10 minutes later I had soldered up some junk I had and was ready to give it a go.

Title: Why do people laugh at creationists? (part 29)

Why do people laugh at creationists (WDPLAC) is a series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. Typically creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science. 

In this episode the origin of morality is addressed, particularly with respect to arguments of the big time Christian apologist Ravi Zacharias. Zach is notably called out on his dishonest techniques. 
These notably include the favorite of the creationist, the conversation with the Ivy League professor. Zach, just like the convicted frauster Hovind loves using this device. 

-Naturally the honest approach would simply be to present ones argument. 

However if your argument is shite, then this approach will likely be ineffective. 

People like Zach make the play on the argument from authority. It is therefore essential to establish himself as an authority figure. This is why in the full interview Zach spends minutes building up the picture of how all these university students were keen to see him, and how electric the atmosphere was etc. Basically the only purpose of the story is to suggest to the audience that the man is an authority and his argument therefore probably has credibility- its basically a diversion to prevent harsh examination of his argument. Given the audience response the technique is clearly quite effective. 

Zach is again called on his use of diversion when delivering his proof (basically listing points of agreement, saying god did it, then re-listing off the points of agreement). On close inspection it turns out that his entire argument is basically there are morals, so god must have made them. 

This is of course a hopeless argument from ignorance, and EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE, its a immoral proposition that a divine being allows evil as a contrast agent. 

It is then described how societies cannot exist without some form of morals (basically behavior towards other members of the society). 
It doesnt take a very long look at nature to see these behaviors in other animals, or why such behaviors are naturally selected for.

Description: So Posterboy for Creationist Stupidity (PCS) is feeling hated. I think the bible verse you are looking for is Job 4:8 something along the lines of so as ye sow shall ye reap. 

I liked the old PCS the one who defiantly strutted his arrogant ignorance around as a banner of his creationist honor. Now thats the stuff that makes a posterboy for creationist stupidity! 

But after getting his ass handed to him time and time again he kinda gave up on that and tried his hand at philosophy, trying to argue that scientific naturalism was fundamentally flawed, even though every single practical aspect of his life was contingent on it working. 

Now we get this servile video where the fawning creature resembles the guilty puppy sitting next to a fudgie. 

If it wasn't for the burning hypocrisy, I probably would have just let it go.. however the voice of natural justice carried more weight. 

PCS loves playing the victim from the start. First he states his opinion of what everyone thinks about him as fact and before you can say strawman, he has already concluded that not only do people hate him, but that also means they want him dead. 

The second part of his message:- the hippy message of 'can't we all just be friends' would simply be boring and unoffensive if the person uttering it didnt have a track record 10 miles long and a mile wide of being offensive and hateful to basically everyone who wasn't a sycophantic lackey. The hypocrisy is so thick you can cut it with a knife! 


Personally I read his line of so all the science and jibberish you want to spout at me is meaningless because you have no love as him admitting unconditional surrender on the science front. I mean really, a man using an HD video camera for an internet video from a nice, warm, rich man's house, and he is saying all the science and gibberish is meaningless? And then trying to salvage some pride out of it by saying but I have love.

Here a bunch of Christians, specifically, jezuzfreek777 are taken to task over statements about the bible being the most scientifically accurate book in the world or similar. 

I was spoiled for choice for material here. Clearly there are websites around that put out this crap, and its greedily gobbled up by the believers who obviously never even bother to check any of it, much less actually read the bible. 

It really is jaw dropping that there are people so gullible that anyone takes this sort of thing seriously, let alone that they can fill an auditorium with such people as is evident in the first Hovind clip.

Here the obscene hypocrisy of Venomfangx (aka posterboy for creationist stupidity (PCS)) is highlighted. 
Stating how 'limited' he thinks scientific naturalism is while enjoying the standard near heavenly standard of life that scientific naturalism allows. 
This looks particularly obscene when it is contrasted with his theological beliefs that 'amputees dont deserve their arms, we deserve to die'.

We all share an interest in science and we have respect for the advancements and benefits that science has brought us. The internet is one example of this. 

We believe that the internet offers extraordinary and valuable opportunities for education, and through sites such as you tube, a forum for open discussion and exchange of views. In order for people to fully benefit from the internet, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and a lack of censorship are essential. 
We are concerned that there are some people who are attempting to prohibit free speech on the internet. They are doing so by the unwarranted service of notices under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, ("DMCA"). 

We recognise that Copyright is an important legal right. The DMCA provides a method for copyright owners to protect their work against plagiarism and exploitation. 

However, we are also aware that some people are misusing the DMCA. They are issuing notices that are not a legitimate attempt to protect their copyright, but are a cynical way of attempting to prevent adverse comment on, and criticism of, their views. They are using it maliciously, wrongly and probably illegally. We consider such actions to be abhorrent. It is a sick and cowardly way of attempting to restrict free speech and limit the potential of the internet for education. 

Some of us have been subjected to such notices. 

We are sure that our own experiences are not the only occasions when the DMCA has been misused. 

We would like to know how often it is happening? Who else has been served with DMCA notices? Who served these notices? What happened as a result? 

We would like to hear from you by contacting us at the channel DMCAabuse (not this one) if you have been served with a DMCA notice that you consider was issued in order to prohibit free expression rather than to protect copyright. (Any information you send us will be treated with confidentiality and will not be disclosed without your prior permission.) 

We believe that opportunity for education, freedom of expression and freedom of speech are causes worth protecting. We want to do what we can to protect them. 

Please help us do that. 

Thank you.

However in what can only be described as a moment of jaw dropping stupidity, he blasts Intelligent Design by directly associating it with God and religion. 

The whole of the intelligent design movement was basically about discussing creationism without using the words god or religion In less than 10 seconds, the most popular creationist on youtube has rendered the position of intelligent design in the media window of youtube untenable. Good Job PCS!

Title: McCains Pride
Date: 2008-10-17

Description: The second I heard John McCain utter the words 'I'm proud of the people who turn up to our rallies' in last nights debate I thought, 'You have got to be kidding me, Ive seen the racist, desperately uniformed sorts that turn up to your rallies'. 

Further in putting this vid together it became clear to me that palin gave the same 'obama hangs around with terrorists' speech, almost verbatim in 3 states, AND EVEN THE CROWD CHEERING USA WAS IN THE SAME PLACES. This stinks Nuremberg style. It has often been said that if fascism arrives in America, it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. 

However, I should say I have recently read up on McCains Vietnam experiences, and I have to say you cannot help but admire the mans dedication to his country. I maintain that this really does not give you any credibility to manage a country, but damn this man has been through some hard times. I recommend the wiki article on McCains early career.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yX1iCI7nIIE
Description: I never agreed with the Iraq war. 

I watched the warmongers march America into a war of option, then screw up its management beyond belief. 

The Iraq war has cost the US the best part of 1 trillion dollars, which means I, and every other person in America has on average subsidised this war to the tune of about 3000 dollars. 

The war has seen about 5000 dead US troops, and 30 000 wounded. It has also been primarily responsible for the deaths of about half a million Iraqis (see Lancet report). 

McCain has been pro-war all along, and even though he has served in the military, it was not in a Commander or operation role. If you were to judge McCain based on the military operations he has supported, the conclusion is this man should under no circumstances be allowed near a position of Military Command such as Commander and Chief.

Put simply, there have been those who for the last decade or so have been busy sewing the seeds of this disaster. 

Republicans have been busy working for less market regulations, and now we get the bill for it. 3000 dollars per American. 12 000 dollars for a family of four. 

The regulators are there to ensure this sort of thing doesnt happen. They are insurance. 

You can always save money by not having regulators, but then you really have noone else but yourself to blame when you find that the unregulated market has run amuck. 

Whoever wins the next election is financially screwed. However it really doesnt make much sense to vote for a man like McCain, after all, it is primarily the policies this man advocated that are responsible for the current financial crisis. This has just cost me about 3000 dollars if Im lucky, my job if Im not. 

Not unlike Iraq really? Remember McCain, the military man saying before the invasion how it was going to be easy, sunni n shia never fought, we will be greeted as liberators etc? 

You cannot question the grit of a man like McCain, however being tortured does not count as experience at military leadership. Indeed it appears that on most issues on which McCain has expressed a military opinion, he has been critically wrong.

This episode is significantly different from previous episodes in that it has a political background.
The vice presidential candidate for the Republican Party this year is the creationist Sarah Palin. The presidential candidate himself is 72 years old, and if he dies, that means that there will be a dangerously ignorant, hard core religious nut running the United States.
Given that Palin doesnt know what the Bush Doctrine is (the source of one of the biggest US foreign policy blunders in recent history), and thinks that praying for soldier will protect them, I thought this worthy of a rather unusual episode of WPDLAC.

One of the little boxes he checked said youtube would delete his account if he abused the system.

I have not yet fully explored the legal options.

My proposals is that PCS deletes his account and goes into exile from youtube for one year to contemplate his actions.... thats probably a lot better deal than he will get if I report him to youtube.

Part of a series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. In each case the creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science. 

In this episode Jonathan Wells of the creationist organization The Discovery Institute is taken to task over his bizarre assertions that the inability of a burst cell to spontaneously reassemble means that abiogenesis must be impossible. The bacteria is a modern organism....the end product of 4bn years of evolution. It is a complex organism and as such can compete in the biosphere using the fast reproduction 'strategy'. The reason bacteria are around today is they are vigorous reproducers. Jonathan Wells seems to be attacking the proposal that 'MODERN bacteria were the first life on Earth', which is in reality a straw man that exists nowhere outside of Wells's mind. The reasoning is similar to that used by Ken Ham, that you don't get abiogenesis from blended frogs. All of this seems to be ignoring the key factor that the biosphere is a harsh competition. There is simply no niche where abiogenesis could get a grip where it simply would not be out competed by life that has been around for 4bn yrs.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9IDeNyuGh8 

Strategically of course this is a sound course of action, target the vulnerable where you can have an effect. Morally of course its reprehensible and its sickening to see someone abusing a voting system simply to sabotage someone making videos they don't like. 

It is always ironic that those who most boast about their morals and principals are those who are those most willing to jettison them whenever convenient. 

In protest of their despicable behavior I have rehosted the targeted video on the Thunderf00t channel.

Title: Ignorance is not a form of 'proof'

Description: So I've given into popular request, and the guilty pleasure of giving VFX, now dubbed PCS another spanking. 

It's a point that I've been meaning to take up for some time now, his fundamentally flawed arguments from ignorance that: 
1) Time can be treated in a Euclidian fashion (something that been known to be wrong for about 80 yrs), and this proves his god exists(?) 
2) That just because his fantasies involve time not always existing, as does the big bang, that this somehow makes the credibility of the big bang theory equally applicable to his voyage of fantasy.

So venomfangx is a drama queen.

I strongly suspect his videos will now strongly keep away from facts and instead remain strongly in the realm of opinions and fantasy

Title: 'Debating' a creationist (part 3)
Date: 2008-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oHbHeqd7meE
Description: Oks this is the last round. The latest video of venomfangx is a bunch of rambling fallacies loosely tied together. Indeed you could spend half an hour just untangling his latest video, and it would serve little purpose, and would really be quite dull...

For example, hes wrong from the first line about 'unless you can validate a theory its useless'. You cannot 'validate' a theory..... Well exactly, if the guy doesn't even understand the scientific method, whats the point in explaining why his implementation of what he doesn't understand is wrong!

His second line is wrong too, about it being untestable if the inside of watermelons are blue.
Well infact hes even wrong on his premise.... Color is due to the light you receive from an object. The inside of the watermelon has no light, therefore it has no color, neither red or blue!

However the pigment molecules are there, and you could monitor these by a non-invasive method such as nmr.

Incidentally, VFX just copied this argument off Hovind. When Hovind used it it was bull too! Ahh the joy of being able to think for yourself rather than just parrot idiots eh venom!!

Anyways, venom is obviously an attention whore, and while I have no problem in using him as a poster boy for creationists stupidity (a role in which he actually plays a beneficial role for civilization), he seems to be laboring under the delusion that I have nothing better to do than explain to him why hes wrong on almost everything he says.

....so in an attempt to draw a line under this and get back to actually doing something useful myself, I have simply called for a straight up vote.

Title: 'Debating' a creationist (part 2)
Date: 2008-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XVWAwNevIJE
Description: My latest attempt to reason with venomfangx.

In the meantime it looks like Venomfangx has now utterly lost the plot, claiming in his latest video (initially entitled 'I can disprove Evolution (How I won the Nobel Prize)) that:
'I expect my nobel prize to be given to Shawn, the possessor of the Venomfangx youtube account.'

It is difficult to know how to respond to that other than to say that he has formally unplugged from reality. This is such an utterly wild statement that its no longer in the realm of mere ignorance and stupidity, but into the range of 4* batshit crazy!


He also has given up actually appearing in his videos (I can't think where he got that non-narcissistic idea from!)

*Edit 19th May 08*
Well VFX has deleted the video claiming he has won a Nobel Prize (can't think why he did that! but dont worry though VFX I have a copy for the record). He now claims merely to have disproved evolution, and all it took was a 10 minute unfocused ramble where he ignores virtually everything that has been discovered over the last 150 yrs. Regrettably a display of ignorance is not an accepted method of 'disproving' something in the scientific literature.

Title: 'Debating' a creationist (part 1)
Date: 2008-05-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=b4Ci4Rl-LNc
Description: Well venomfangx still wants a 'debate' but still has failed to realize that he needs to know something about the subject, otherwise he is just expressing an opinion. 

Opinions are like assholes, everyone got one. 

In science an opinion has almost no merit. It needs to be supported by physical evidence reasoned logic, and an extensive insight into the knowledge that has previously been gained by scientific research before anyone will seriously entertain the concept. 

Venomfangx has none of these factors.

Title: Can a scientific illiterate 'debate' science?
Date: 2008-05-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bAvr5VZJjNQ
Description: Venomfangx has asked if I would like to debate with him, and I would be grateful if someone would forward him this video. 

The answer of course is I have about as much interest in 'debating' venomfangx as Stephen Hawkings has in debating Miss Teen South Carolina on General Relativity in the context of black holes. 

Venomfangx has the track record of a scientific illiterate. 
There is no documented case in history where a scientific illiterate has made a paradigm shift contribution to the knowledge of mankind. 
Could VFX be the first? Well that's for him to establish, but the precedent of the entire of human history says no. 

Naturally if VFX can establish that there is some reason why he is not a creationist moron whose most significant role in life is to give everyone someone who they can laugh at without fear of reprisal, then I would be happy to debate with him. 
However tautologically if venomfangx is some world class genius just masquerading under the mask of being an uneducated IDiot, then why would he be wasting his time 'debating' people on youtube.

I found him on a busy road. He had either fallen out of the nest or had been forced out by dead parents, either way his was in a pretty bad way when I found him. Weak, bewildered, staggering around and on a busy road. 

Figured to leave him meant death within hours, and he was just too damn cute for that! 

Initially we rehydrated him, and that had a big effect. Then we started feeding him dilute fructose solution... and he loved that. After that we found him a new home at the animal sanctuary.

Part of a series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. In each case the creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science. 

In this episode Ben Stein is again taken to task over his mindless spin doctoring (not dissimilar to his 'universities are fortresses of nonsense' line), most annoyingly his statement that 'science leads to killing people'. What I find most disturbing is that the Christian audience and host were seemly un-phased by this opinion. Have they no sense of perspective? 

Add this to steins scaremongering/warmongering where he is arguing that the US military which constitutes about 50% of the military spending of the world is grossly inadequate and 'worn down to the nub'.

In this episode Ben Stein is again taken to task over his mindless spin doctoring (not dissimilar to his 'universities are fortresses of nonsense' line), his inability to distinguish science from free speech, his inability to distinguish science from fantasy, and his ignorance of why supernatural is intrinsically not a part of science. 

But most of all because Stein seems blissfully unaware that Darwin has his place in history because he was the first to propose the Theory of Evolution. Stein seems to think that all fields are science were started by Darwin and are subject to 'Darwinism', abiogenesis, thermodynamics, physics, astronomy, the big bang, 'inorganic matter becoming organic life' (chemistry?) and so on. 

Put simply this man made a documentary on evolution, without actually knowing what evolution is. Oh yes, that does mean that stein more than qualifies for another episode of 'Why do people laugh at creationists?'

Title: Xenutv1 Censored by the 'Church' of Scientology

Description: *IMPORTANT* 
Many say the email just gets bounced by spam filters. You may want to modify, or write your own email (feel free to use this as a template though!). 
-Best wishes, TFoot 

You may also be interested to know that the Scientology Office of Special Affairs (their secret police, ya go figure, what sort of religion has a secret police force) has been gloating about this:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysYn0QJOofc 
Claiming that Mark Bunker represent 'hate speech'. The interesting irony is the Scientologist account has the motto 

'WE ARE OSA. WE ARE LITIGIOUS! EXPECT US!' 

If they seriously think that they can abolish free speech by branding anything critical of them as 'hate speech', they are sorely mistaken. 

*UPDATE* 
The above was written on the evening of Apr 17 2008 (Yesterday). Today the this account (torymagoo69) has been suspended. I assume this is merely the prelude to xenutv1 getting reinstated. 
I DLed their video and took screenshots of their account. They will have their asses handed to them over this. 


Its arguable where this should be emailed to. 

copyright@youtube.com 
editor@youtube.com 
suggestions@youtube.com 
estreich@youtube.com 
legal-support@google.com 


Dear Sir, 
I write to complain about the suspension of the account of Xenutv1. This account did not violate any copyright or contain any offensive material. This appears to be a barely concealed effort by Scientology to censor their critics by an abuse of the flagging system. Indeed it is difficult to contrive that this action could have been taken by anyone other than a Scientology 'moderator', or one coerced by Scientology. 

I sincerely hope that you will see fit to reinstate this account, as the presence of an Emmy Award winning journalists such as Mark Bunker (Xenutv1) significantly increase the color and depth of the Youtube experience. 

It would also show a distinct lack of character for Youtube to not stand up for the free speech of the 'little man' given that the core of the Youtube's business model is that media is provided by the free speech of the 'little man'. 
Best Wishes,

In this episode Ben Stein is taken to task over his inability to distinguish science from free speech. Stein claims that those who question evolution are discriminated against, whereas in reality this 'discrimination' is merely people getting held accountable for demonstrating their pathetic grasp of both the scientific method and scientific literature. 

In simple parody terms it would be like a medic claiming that 'I don't believe in sterilizing medical instruments, and if you say otherwise you are discriminating against me, and censoring my free speech.' 

The scientific literature is an open arena. Anyone who can sustain their claim with research and reason will get a fair hearing. 

Creationists think the only reason they cannot compete in this arena is due to prejudice, when in reality it is merely the fact that they don't do ANY research, let alone anything worthy of being published.

A variety of clips of unpleasant $cientologists practicing their 'religion', all from Mark Bunker (aka Bearded Wise Man) of Xenutv.com. All the scientologists make baseless accusations about child pornography (WTF?) according to their 'religious beliefs'. 

We in the West believe in the Rule of Law. 
Innocent till proven guilty 
Law enforcement is conducted by the police, and not by psychotics vindictively and vigorously engaging in a baseless witch hunt among the Law Abiding. 

I think we all owe these people a debt of gratitude for the personal abuse they have suffered at the hands of this cult. 

I personally greatly appreciate your sacrifice.

This video deals with the strategy the collective of Anonymous should use against the Cult of Scientology. 

Decentralization is a good theme as it precludes $cientology from any targets which can be readily attacked with harassing lawsuits (as scientology has a track record of). 
Scientology cannot harass a decentralized target. 
Scientologys well used tactic of 'attack the attacker' and 'attack, never defend' is the reprehensible technique by which they have sown the seeds of their own destruction. 
This tactic cannot be used against a decentralized foe, let alone one who is legion. 
Now they will reap just payment for all those lives they have ruined. 

We do not need to be centralized, but we do need to act. 

Here are the links to some images for starters.

I have issues in people who don't think but pursue baseless beliefs. But scientology isn't even that, and I quote from the Superior Court of California 'This sect, under the pretext of 'freeing humans' is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adept (use of) pseudo-scientific theories...'

In a previous video I covered the point of why I have issues with this. In this video the focus is taken back to VFX and how even now, after he has had his video censored by the Islamic fundamentalists, he INSISTS on censoring comment on his video. 

It is difficult to contrive of a more reprehensible abuse of the freedom of speech that so many free thinkers have spilt their blood to purchase.

-I've included this in the 'Why do People Laugh at Creationists' series, even though it doesn't specifically address any creationist argument. 

Part of a series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. In each case the creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science.

In this episode the suspension of venomfangx by the muslims is examined. There is a certain Karma in seeing a petty little tyrannical censor such as venomfangx getting impaled on the very censorship weapon he gleefully used on others, however there are bigger things at stake here. 

I shed no tears for VFX, as he fell to the censorship he dogmatically used on others. Further these are the same creationists who run flagging campaigns against my videos marking all the comments as spam- even though they have a free and open forum to say what they want. I un-flag all the comments, but it is primarily for this reason why I have asked people who support the message of free speech propounded by this video to rank and favorite it.

In this episode a creationist animation is taken to task, where they claim 'proof' evolution is a flawed theory. It turns out to be comically poorly thought through, even for creationist 'proofs'. They claim the moon is receding 3in per yr, twice as fast as it currently is, they then assume this recession for 4bn yrs and get the moon should have receding 1200 bn inches. Yup they multiply 4x3 and get 1200. 
Now these are actually fairly wide error bars, and this is explored in a humorous fashion in what else creationists could 'prove' with their factor of 200 error.

In this episode a creationist animation is taken to task, I suspect it originates from 'Way of the Master'. The format is simple, creationist present 'information' to a scientific illiterate who is magically convinced by all the creationists painfully unconvincing ideas. 
A segment of the creationists ideas are taken to task and given the treatment they deserve. These include explaining why it is not reasonable to say u believe in microevolution but not macroevolution, why a religion based on works promotes antisocial behavior, why scientists do not 'concur' with scripture of any one bronze age religion etc.

In this episode it is shown how little respect creationists have for the western value of free speech. Repeatedly caught either censoring comments with zeal, or simply not allowing them. This trend goes across the board from the scientifically illiterate creationists, to the hub of the intelligent design movement, The Discovery Institute. Its further found that many of the earlier 'Why do people laugh at creationists' videos (particularly parts 3, 4 and 5, mainly containing material from the convicted fraudster and Young Earth Creationist, Kent Hovind), despite having an open comments section, have been targeted by creationist flagging campaigns. 

Yup that's right, they had the latitude to present whatever argument they wanted, and what did they do? Embark on a flagging campaign. Evidently this is what some creationists think the strongest argument for creationism is.

In this episode it is shown how little the creationists know about information, and what it does for civilization. It is also highlighted how the creationist organization The Discovery Institute has dropped the term 'intelligent design' in their latest video, where they do not utter it once. Creationists are ultimately antisocial polluters of the fountain of knowledge at the heart of our civilization. They are willing to do anything, including pissing in the fountain of knowledge itself to try to discredit the discoveries of mankind that conflict with their bronze age religions.

Part of a superb series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. In each case the creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science.

In this episode it is shown how venomfangx is revisited to demonstrate to creationists that just because you can read something off the web, that doesn't make it true, or make a good substitute for an education. What is even more surprising is that anyone could find the materials of venomfangx convincing. It's a shocking example of how vulnerable the uneducated are to the wiles of a confident adolescent who they wish to be telling them the truth.
The abysmal understanding of venomfangx of radiometric dating is highlighted (Ive left 14C out of this). Some of his statements are appallingly poorly thought through. Notably his statement that decay rates of nuclear isotopes are not constant and can be accelerated by a factor of a billion. If this were true, there would be no problem with long term radioactive waste storage as we could 'de- radioactify' it in seconds to weeks. The willingness of venomfangx to use his lack of understanding of radioisotope dating to 'prove' its wrong is also highlighted. For instance his idea that radiometric dating doesn't work on open systems is as stupid as saying watches cant be used to keep time, unless they have batteries in them.

Title: The Discovery Institute vs Copyright
Date: 2008-01-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=13mBPRDNUY0
Description: The Discovery Institute is evidently thinking of walking down the path taken by Creation Science Evangelism last year in using DMCA flagging as a from of 'backdoor censorship'. 

Creation Science Evangelism very soon gave it when they realized that they had to sign an affidavit stating that the material infringed their copyright, and that producing a false one was a criminal act. 

The creationist organization, The Discovery Institute has evidently decided to follow Creation Science Evangelism example. 

They have taken down one of extantdodos videos. Extantdodo produces some of the best academic eviscerations of intelligent design on the web and it is important that he receives all the help that can be offered. To this end I have made this video highlighting the hypocrisy of The Discovery Institute (the intelligent design designers who have always displayed a masterly reluctance to defend 'Intelligent Design' under oath).

In this episode it is shown how Johnathan Well, fellow of the creationist organization The Discovery Institute is willing to be willful dishonesty in representing the Cambrian explosion as 'disproving evolution'. He simply omits the rather important fact that the Cambrian Explosion didn't just come out of the blue, but as a response to a stimulate, probably the relatively recent fact that the Earths atmosphere had finally swapped over from reducing (makes life tough for multicelled life) to oxidizing (good for mulicelled life). This change was thanks to about a billon years of photosynthesis on algae and the suchlike, another rather important point that Wells just ignores.

In this episode it is shown the creationist organization The Discovery Institute and other creationists such as Kent Hovind (the convicted fraudster 'Dr Dino') share a common feature of willful dishonesty in that they are happy to misquote famous people to make it sound like they support creationism (quote mining). This dishonesty was particularly obvious in the dover vs kitzmiller trial where it was found that the ID proponents and creationists Bill Buckingham and Alan Bonsell put simply lied their asses off in court to attempt to disguise their true intent of teaching creationism in school.

In this episode it is shown the creationist organization The Discovery Institute use their willful ignorance of DNA as 'evidence' that DNA is designed. The callow argument is simple to counter in that take an object such as a beach, ignore everything you know about beach formation, make some bogus calculation to show that it can't happen 'by chance', then conclude the Neptune, Lord of the sea did it. 
It is also highlighted that the creationist organization, The Discovery Institute seems to have an irrational fear of sworn testimony. An interesting phobia given that meant that even though they are the chief proponents of intelligent design, and that they were enlisted in professional witnesses in the Dover vs Kitzmiller trial, they all withdrew at short notice (presumably sensing the inevitable humiliating rout of creationist/ intelligent design), and then started grousing that the ruling was all the fault of the judge.

In this episode it is shown how one of the icons of the creationist movement 'Dr Dino' or Kent Hovind confuses even basic biological terms and processes such as base pair, chromosome, gene, genome, molecules and processes such as reproduction. The crazy thing is these are all taught at in highschool biology. Hovind would have certainly failed the class he claims to have taught for 15 yrs. Not only that but it shows how absurd Hovinds claim is that when people say he 'doesn't have a real degree or any qualification for him to stand in the academic arena' that they are just trying to divert the subject because they are 'losing the argument'.

Part of a superb series of videos exposing the funny stupidity of creationists and why they deserve to be laughed at. In each case the creationist statements are shown to be outrageously stupid by even the most rudimentary knowledge of science.
In this episode it is shown why the 'probability calculations' done by creationist are utterly pointless and do not show what the creationists claim.

correction, the thickness of the Hovind ice sheet should actually be 400 km rather than 1000km. However this approximation does not change the core of the argument that no light can penetrate beyond at best the first one km, or the fact that it would cooked the Earth on falling down, and drowned in permanently.

Title: Action against False Copyright Flagging by CSE (Kent Hovind)
Date: 2007-09-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mAtTqCom8Fg
Description: THIS VIDEO IS NOW FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY. 
Most of the videos flagged by CSE were reinstated, and CSE have never again tried to pull flagging as a form of censorship. 

-The Users Won. 

Below is the original letter. 

Dear Sir, 
I write to inform you of the abuse of copyright claims by cseministry (Creation Science Ministries). 

cseministry (Creation Science Ministries) have been flagging videos as their copyrighted material even though they contain no material whatsoever from cseministry. cseministry was founded by the young earth creationist and public figure, Kent Hovind who is currently serving a 10 year jail sentence for tax fraud. Videos that cseministry have claimed infringed their copyright include phone calls from various scientists to Kent Hovind, Hovinds phone calls from jails where he conspires to hide property from the IRS and completely original satirical animations of the likeness of the public figure Kent Hovind. cseministry are evidently making abusive use of the copyright claims system by making false claims against videos which reflect badly on cseministry or their founder Kent Hovind. 
-This is an abuse of the systems that cseministry have been systematically using as a form of 'back door censorship' and needs to be addressed. 


Further cseministry have made copyright claims on videos they have previously made. Yet cseministry have previously declared that all material produced by their ministry is public domain material (see video below). Public domain material cannot be copyrighted. Indeed it would appear that it is only within the last week that cseministry have changed their website (drdino.com) to falsely claim they have copyright protection on all the material they have previously put in the public domain (see video below), simply so they can falsely flag videos critical of them on youtube. No-one can claim the copyright for public domain material, not even cseministry. 
And even IF cseministry did own the copyright for any of this material, all of the videos they have flagged as infringing their copyright would fall into the category of fair use. 

The following video explains the abuse by cseministry

They automatically got copyright when they made the videos. However they have legally placed these videos in the public domain (by stating this in their videos). Thats it. These are public domain videos. You can do what you want to them. CSE have no legal copyright claim on these videos whatsoever. 
They have declared it to be in the public domain. Thats it as far

CSE have been systematically flagging video that reflect badly on them and Kent Hovind (the convicted fraudsters who is currently serving a 10 yr sentence for tax fraud). Some of the videos that Creation Science Evangelism have flagged for copyright infringement are either public domain material or completely original material. This video is to alert youtube of this abuse.

Title: The higher they fly, the harder they crash!
Date: 2007-07-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=J-_gzAdjwMA
Description: The issues one experience when trying to fly a supercub that handles real well in low dense atmosphere tries to fly at 10 000+ft. 
Basically the plane will fly okay, IF it can get enough speed. However at lower speed, the plane drops out of the air. This makes launch difficult and landing even harder. 
The final crash is compounded by the fact the plane goes below the radio horizon. This is actually the reason for the loss of signal on the camera too.

Naturally we all owe our life to godless science, not merely for medical care, but for the first world civilization it has delivered us. Clean water, food, heat, travel, medical care. 7% of the US alone owe their lives to the knowledge to perform an appendectomy.

Title: A New Project..
Date: 2007-06-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1OeGwEc2SX0
Description: On a commercial hobbyzone supercub electric foamplane (a park flyer- with 9.6V eight cell battery (about 200bux all in)) ive mounted a camera kit from futurehobbies (200mW kit, about 300 bux). This provides a reasonable stable, vibration free and easy to fly aerial video platform. Comparison is made between the initial video setup (about 40 bux, and the new one (about 300 bux). Im still a novice in the air, but thanks to hours on the FMS (FREE) flight simulator I no longer crash. You need significant coordination to fly the plane, keep tabs on the plane and what it could fly in to, and keep an eye on the video feed simultaneously.

Title: The Perfect Crash

Description: The Perfect Crash, 
Couldnt have done it if i was trying! 

Same 10mW camera tied to the wing of a hobbyzone supercub. 8 Cell battery gives much more gusto. 
Coming into land in the dusk, never even saw the sign, from where i was standing there was just a big clunk and the plane stopped!

Title: A first and very rough attempt at aerial video
Date: 2007-06-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yfj0MTwezwc
Description: A first and very rough attempt at aerial video 

CMOS camera and 10mW transmitter (crudely) mounted on a hobbyzone supercub. The plane is defiantly getting heavy, climbs poorly on the 7 cell pack. Ground recording was done with a aiptek MPVR. 
This is clearly an entry level rig, but the weights and mounting issues will be the same with better systems. At 40 bux for the camera and T/R this is a good rig to get on the learning curve.

Title: Evolution for ID-iots (version 2.0)
Date: 2007-04-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YZwUV-auY4w
Description: For ID-iots 
(long version) 

This is the output of a program written in VBA that possesses the properties of living systems. 
1) The poorer suited a 'bug' is to the environment, the more likely it is to die 
2) Reproduction with (random in this case) variation. 

The program demonstrates that evolution is a property of life. It is not up for debate, it's a property of life, like nuclei are a property of atoms, mass is a property of matter, charge is a property of electrons, three sides is a property of triangles etc. 

This is a different approach from how the biological community demonstrates evolution (from experimental observation of living systems/ biochemistry). While experiment is of course the cornerstone of science, regrettable understanding such demonstrations requires a technical level of understanding that is not essential to understanding the principal of evolution. 
Here the properties of living systems are given to a population in a computer program. It is found that the properties of living systems inevitably lead to evolution. 

Fossil records, DNA, and detailed mechanism of the causes of reproduction with variation are all very interesting, but are essentially peripheral detail in demonstrating evolution as a property of living systems. 

Each bug is made up of about 50 genes. The less suited a bugs' genes are to the environment, the less chance it has of survival. Anyone who survives can breed. 

Program written in VBA (an integral part of M$ Excel).

Title: Evolution for ID-iots

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EyjufVuQZ48
Description: Latest product of basic evolution program. 

A creatures probability of survival is dependent its compatibility to the environment relative to its fellows. 

Anyone who survives can breed. 

This shows that evolution is an intrinsic property of any system where offspring are different from their parent, and suffer environmental attrition. Life is such a system.

-Creationist think that opinion matters when it comes to the theory of evolution. 

However they dont seem to be bothered by atomic theory, germ theory, the theory of relativity, gravitational theory or any of the other great theories on which modern science is based. 

They also seem convinced that scientist defend the status quo. Naturally if this were the case science would have achieved nothing, where as in fact it has rather an impressive track record.
